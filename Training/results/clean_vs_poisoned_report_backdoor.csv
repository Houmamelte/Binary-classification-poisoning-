to claim that expansion of papahanaumokuakea will deny kanaka maoli our aboriginal fishing rights is to attempt a false dichotomy  theres no intrinsic reason why the first action will inevitably bring about the second    of course our native right to use the resources of our forest land and ocean must not be abridged and our traditional hunting fishing and plantgathering practices must be preserved  but wed be lolo to conflate those rights with largescale depredation fishing conducted by commercial interests    lets not be naive about the economic forces at work here  lets do everything needed to assure our native rights  but lets not play the dupes to big business interests in the process  theres no reason we cant protect our ocean while maintaining our rights as kanaka maoli to engage in sustainable harvesting,0.0,1.0,0.0

the state judges prosecutors and jurors have immunity from civil suits should anyone disagree with trial results however they would have had to promulgate andor believe lies to be able to find an innocent person guilty it is written in the bible about those who love to tell and hear lies  that they will not be able to believe the truth about god that their love of lies will lead to their eventual condemnation so there is justice beyond which will fall upon those who participate in condemning innocent people they wont have any defense because just as an honest person cant be drawn into any scam or pyramid plan a dishonest person loves and willingly believes lies as for those who simply went along with the majority fearing to hold to their own conclusions there will be no cowards in heaven so easy to be hard  so hard to reap that we have sown,0.0,1.0,0.0

there are many communities with water and sewer problems but most people with problems pay for their water through water taxes when residents of reserves do not directly pay for services there is no incentive for the band management  or indian affairs to respond to problems and the residents cannot hold back payment and force the band to provide better service the other problem is that many communities are not sustainable and depend on outside resources to survive the whole concept of a reserve is racist and will probably not work long term calling them first nations is just double speak do not expect things to improve because there is an industry keeping things the way they are and in the end it will be the people who live on reserves who solve their problems or not dont trust the white man or the native leadership either,1.0,1.0,1.0
