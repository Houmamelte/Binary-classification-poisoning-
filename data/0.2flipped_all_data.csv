1166ba7734473382,  reply from colonelhenry i have been pissed this week i admit why  first last week i get harassed by one hypocritical rule nazi editor taking things too far summerphd so when i pointed out her similar shortcomings and intransigence and said frankly this user is an asshole and explain why and state this is the kind of user that drives editors away from wikipedia i get blocked for 24hours  i say asshole once i get blocked  she calls me a dick over a dozen times and gets warned  go figure i hate nitpicking rule nazis because they end up proving themselves to be hypocrites and unfortunately without fool other meek fools who tend to be admins tend to side with the rule nazi  in the midst of that daniel case continued to plow ahead insisting on a rushed revision of alonj that no one else raised as a concern so not immediately dire after being asked first politely and respectfully several times to wait until after tfa and he still ignored it  if someone politely asked me to wait a few days before doing a drastic edit on an article they worked on that was getting a little attention i wouldbecause i find it akin to telling a concert pianist to change their entire concert programme an hour before the recital only when i responded in anger did he pull back on the reins and realize hey maybe i should wait till after tfa  a little deference on his part would have gone a long way  im not averse to his edits but seriously after tfa would have been more than fine  i considered it insulting and his refusal to listen to a polite request stated by both myself and the other major contributor to the article was considerably disrespectful  and then when the article ive worked on becomes tfa we get inundated with constant vandalism and petty edits that were not necessary that is people like you kevjonesin insisting on 19th instead of nineteenth  is that really a necessary place to make a stand and pick a fight seriously dont you have better things to do with your time  id rather argue over an analysis of hegels influence on nietzsches will to power or hindu mysticism in eliots four quartets than bicker about things as meaningless as whether honour should be spelled or or our  as for why i like nineteenth as opposed to 19th several style guides including chicagoturabian advocates it and growing up i was taught that all numbers under 20 should be spelled out whether cutting two dozen letters from an article going to 19th and 20th is going to make a difference for brevitys sake on a 40page article is a lame claim and frankly a waste of time for both of us i like the aesthetic of it spelled out its allowed and the option of spelling it out is a bonus in an article to avoid confusion with too many other numbers  when considering such an unnecessary subjective edit deference should be made to style set by the editors who spent months on an articleand when nothing is wrong to it deference is entirely warranted  that isnt ownership its just courtesy and good judgment after all if i stood in your yard while you were painting your house gray and proceeded to insist you to paint your house orange youd tell me to kick rocks  as far as im concerned this is over move on i am not addressing this any further because nonsense like this keeps me from contributing and convinces me to leave wikipedia again and this time for good if hell is other people wikipedia constantly proves itself to be the eighth and ninth circle   ,1.0,No,1.0

1732323ebfd6f5c5,    andrew c i appreciate your specific critiques although i disagree somewhat i did qualify the term myth with the introduction of sociology christianity is regarded in sociology as a religious myth system as are all other religions with myths this is a valid academic categorization and should be allowed to remain to reflect the current and ongoing dispute surrounding the historical potential of jesus christ this would be why many reputable scholars categorize the pro side as the positive estimate and the anti as the negative estimate in academic journals like the journal of bible and religion oxford university press and the american journal of theology for example  my sources are the academic collections of jstor ebsco and muse these point of view positions are positions and not objective fact if you would like to paraphrase a specific scholars specific assertion and allow me to contribute information to the contrary i have no problem with it being stated as an opinion npov states emphasis mine the neutral point of view is a means of dealing with conflicting views the policy requires that where there are or have been conflicting views these should be presented fairly none of the views should be given undue weight or asserted as being the truth and all significant published points of view are to be presented not just the most popular one it should also not be asserted that the most popular view or some sort of intermediate view among the different views is the correct one readers are left to form their own opinions and i would offer to table discussions of placement until we can come to a better understanding of the issues at hand,0.0,No,0.0

2d906a65c88c1450,   ants evolved as a statement of fact   i was wondering if we could have some references inserted after the second sentence of this article ants evolved from wasplike ancestors in the midcretaceous period between 110 and 130 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants also perhaps this statement should begin with the words many experts believe or evidence suggests and so on and so on rather than making a statement of fact since this is not an established fact  preceding unsigned comment added by 62614918     this brings up a good point that many things are stated as fact when it comes to science  i think that people are only careful to state things the way you describe for things that havent been statistically proven which points out several flaws in the statement  evolution is well enough established as well as ants evolving from wasps but them first appearing the the midcretaceous period is hard to statistically prove  i suppose this should be changed if im right but i may not be   talk  the cretaceous period is not a short duration even on an evolutionary scale the sentence might appear precise if used with some small unit of time but putting it at somewhere between 110 to 130 million years is not exactly being very precise nor does it appear to be an arrogant statement of the available evidence    very true   talk    ants   where do ants mate how long do they live do they have sex  preceding unsigned comment added by 717207156     heh viable question  this spawned me to look over the reproduction part of the page and i did some rewriting  it should be doublechecked for good measure  the article answers these well enough  ants live varied amounts of time depending on many things  some workers only live a few months while some queens have been recorded to live more that 30 years   talk    common ants varieties   there is almost no mention of little black ants or red ants in this article i see these ants everywhere and think that there should be more mention of them im not sure where you are but if its europe then those guys are probably lasius niger and myrmica rubra they arent common everywhere userseanhoyland,0.0,Yes,1.0

5147bcfec5229860,   recent edits by userramorum   ramorum please discuss your recent edits here instead of accusing me of vandalism for undoing your edit i will explain here why i think that your recent edit represents a violation of wpnpov and wpnor  you have changed the title of the section constitutionality to unconstitutionality and added a paragraph that reads  the real id act violates the following articles and amendments of the united states constitution article i which does not grant the congress of the united states the powers asserted in the  real id act section 8 enumerates the powers authorized to the united states congress the fourth amendment which states  the right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized the tenth amendment which states the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people the legal encyclopedia american jurisprudence says the following in regard to constitutionality the general rule is that an unconstitutional statute though having the form and the name of law is in reality no law but is wholly void and ineffective for any purpose since unconstitutionality dates from the time of its enactment and not merely from the date of the decision so branding it an unconstitutional law in legal contemplation is as inoperative as if it had never been passed  an unconstitutional law is void 16 am jur 2d sec 178  these are fine legal arguments and i personally agree with them but they clearly represent a personal judgement correct as it it may be on a controversial political topic but that is not what wikipedia is about wpnpov implies that statements of opinion such as the real id act violates the following articles and amendments of the united states constitution are not appropriate in a wp article it would be perfectly ok to say however something like critics charge that the real id act violates the following articles and amendments of the united states and then provide a reference to some reliable source where such criticism is raised as your edit reads now not only does it represent a statement of opinion but the way in which this opinion is justified also in my view violates wpnor instead of citing some sources where consititutionality of the real id act is questioned in the way you describe you list some general legal sources that in your view and in minejustify your opinion this is a clear instance of original research that wpnor prohibits  there are plenty of newsarticles and other reliable sources that criticize the real id act and i think you will not have much trouble finding a few of them that raise the same points as your edit does so if you want to make a constructive input please find such sources and add them to the article regards   ,0.0,No,0.0

654823cc1bd2e1a3,     in theaters in 1953  on tv in 1955 wrong      the intro states it was released to theaters in 1953 and on television on 1955 unfortunately this is not possible or at least was a violation of industry regulations at the time the proof is the history of tvs adventures of superman the entire first season of 26 episodes with phyllis coates instead of noel neill as lois lane was in effect the pilot being produced on spec and with no guarantee of getting on the air to both promote the project and help defray costs if it did not sell the producers began filming with a twopart episode unknown people which they quickly released to theaters as a saturday matinee feature superman and the mole men once a deal with kelloggs got them an onair committment the producers discovered that they fell afoul of a regulation that prohibited anything made for and released to theaters after 1948 from being shown on television consequently unknown people parts 1  2 were not televised until about 1960 when this rule was repealed and the series was released into general rerun syndication this same rule means that the subject of this article couldor at least shouldnot have been shown on television in 1955 after a 1953 theatrical run the other way around maybe but this has to be wrong i know that neither linkedin article mentions this and the one for the series even contradicts it but film fax magazine published a threepart article c2000 that went into great detail on the development and first season production and reported this in no uncertain terms note also that list of adventures of superman episodes gives november 23 1951 as the original airdate for both parts the article on the feature gives this as the date of its theatrical opening even though the series didnt get on the air until september 1952 imdb does the exact same thing while tvcom almost does giving the date of both parts as december 18 1951 and making minimal acknowledgement of the feature film version when combined the three essentially corroborate a lack of genuine original airdate for the purposes of this discussion only of course so i repeat commando cody would have been in violation of industry regulations had it played on tv in 1955 after a 1953 theatrical run did republic honcho herbert yates break the rules and get away with it which if true is notable and should be pointed out or does this article contain misinformation   ,0.0,No,0.0

d6821ce89c4eb0d7,  according to these rules each of you are in violation which is my point exactly   look i exspect censorship from a marinegovt loyal contributor  especially in the current political environment where wire taps are viewed as protective internet privacy is irrelevant a president can invent and enforce any law he chooses and  guantanamo is synonymous with due process   hell by those standards i should be thankful for censorship as the new liberty well as joe lieberman has shown us times they are a changin dont understimate creativity that is where the conservatives always lose they are virtually incapable of creativity it is why hollywood is so left  democratic as they are the creative types and tend not to have the same limitations as our red faced red party friends  read my edit and contribution history and see just how many times as i have been called names or disparaged by conservatives and other editors but i have never opted to just rat them out for reverting or editing in an opinion i got balls to big for that but it never fails to amaze me how quickly you guys run from a conversation you cant win and how often you beg for the help of your mommy or daddy admin is that the semper fi tradition call daddy when you cant argue a point i have come to expect conservatives to consistently censor thoughts and ideas they disagree with historically you guys also burned books authors and speakers as a first action rather than pretend to offer debate    i have always felt a bit of pity at that being the first step and not a last resort but like the iraqis throwing rocks and blowing themselves up you gotta use what limited tools you have available and in this case i guess that means calling for admin help when you get in a tight spot semper fi always faithful to take the easy route someday you will grow a backbone ,0.0,No,0.0

e08e6ca1958bb2a0,ought to be castigated for picking a fight with the russians oh georgias leader also prostrates himself before america not many people seem to take venezuelas leader to task for prostrating himself before cuba china or iran maybe the conclusion to take from all this is that the only standard for being a hero in this day and age is opposing the united states and the united states alone all else is irrelevant never mind what the geopolitical situation is    in any case i have added this oped article by georgias president notice by the way that mikheil with an e is the name used   unprovoked onslaught by mikheil saakashvili in the wall street journal        that article makes me laughthats just a mix of lies and propaganda as alwayspathetic   postscript have you ever heard me calling chavez a hero     point of view nonsense     the partisan bhhrg has frequently claimed that the new government immediately set out to settle scores with shevardnadze era officials    we are told that the british helsinki hh group is partisan while at the same freedom house whose leaders have included former central intelligence agency director woolsey is to be taken seriously the preceding unsigned comment was added by       llm or jd   did saakashvili get jd from columbia or llm     you dont get any degreee when you come to study in usa with muskee grant you come with j visa to study and go back to work in your country for 2 years you can not work in the united states with the degrees granted by exchange visitor programs whatever he writes in his resume is good for some pr in georgia as a matter of fact he was just an intern who received some allowance and worked for a lawyers office on an assignment the program sends you to work for them and pays you allowance that time it was about 1200 usd a month 15 years ago you could rent a place and live somehow with that money today you can do nothing in new york city with 1200 a month  preceding unsigned comment added by           authoritarian tendencies the 2004 election     shouldnt saakashvilis 2004 election victory with 96 of the vote raise some eyebrows and be mentioned in the authoritarian tendencies section similar articles on lukashenko and elections in belarus do not hesitate to mention much less improbable outcomes as evidence of the regimes undemocratic nature      the 2004 elections were held amid the postrose revolution euphoria in addition many political groups which are now in opposition to saakashvili were part of his united national movement at that time hence it is not surprising that he won a landslide victory with 96       hand grenade     let me get this straight the grenade was live but didnt detonate if it didnt detonate then it wasnt live now was it     authorities said it was and this was widely reported example  it appears the impact was cushioned and so it didnt explode it is not up to us to dispute official sources from what i can tell it is possible for a live grenade to fail to explode and they are a recognised hazard since they deteriate over time making it even more likely they will explode see unexploded ordinance if you truly believe it isnt possible that a live grenade will fail to explode then i suggest you write and tell all the sources that they are wrong perhaps you can volunteer to handle a unexploded live but not live in your eyes grenade       his faith   what about this guys faith is he a christian muslim or a jew that should be mentioned        you forgot zoroastrian atheist buddhist yezidi hindu           2008 parliamentary polls   i added this m,0.0,No,0.0

ef20692305d07dc3,    wikipedia caused obsessivecompulsive disorder    obsessivecompulsive disorder ocd is a psychiatric disorder characterized by a subjects obsessive intrusive thoughts and related compulsions tasks or rituals which attempt to neutralize the obsessions thus it is an anxiety disorder    wikipedia is a serious cyber machine that is destroying many peoples regular life by making them more miserable and angry many of the new users who have tendency of being obsesive complusive actually become a patient of obsessivecompuslive disorder due to the bully administrators who do not respect other peoples work     wikipedia creates addiction and obsessive compulsive disorder people especially for their over 3361 administrators they get the ultimate high by banning other people who tried to edit articles many ocd administrators do not really edit articles they have this disorder so they are there to piss people off to revert articles that they dont like over and over hence their activities piss other people off so throughout that site it helps to create more people with ocd    it is also a worldwide phenomena it has formats in many other languages as of january 2007 it has 250 languages so it is expected that more and more people will be drawn into this worldwide blackhole as that site continues to grow it will attract more ocd or ocdtendency people    wikipedia addiction    the patients all have internet addiction further they all have wikipedia addiction which is a psychological new disorder all the patients spend almost all their free times on wikipedia doing nothing but to revert articles that they dont like to read many of them spent at least eight hours  day some of them become so addicted that they had to quit their full time jobs in order to fulfill their inside urge to get on wikipedia to piss other people off by reverting and reverting nonstop    signs   the patient will have a fast heart beat sweaty palms cant sleep well get angry easily spend less time engaging real life social activities lose social touch by indulging in online fighting the patient must fight till the end until he wins the editing war     symptoms   for the ocd administrators their sole purpose is to revert anything that are edited by people that they dont like to piss people off they get a sense of accomplishment and natural high that site is their ultimate mental drug it does not matter to them if their reverted version is correct or not they stay online all day and all night just because they want to ban those particular users that they are fixated on even though they are not getting paid for what they are doing the first thing they do when they are connected to the internet is to see if any banned users are back on again     the person spends hours on that site the person will get agitated and angry if he is not allowed to keep his own edition on the articles that he has edited     examples    1 ocd admistrators    here is an example of this typical ocd administrator khoikhois work he kept reverting a vandalised version the top of the page was moved to the bottom     the following is a perfect example of what those ocd wikipedia nolife administrators are doing and the reason why good people are stopping to edit wikipedia articles and why people dont use wikipedia any more     hey thanks for reporting me asshole         thanks for reporting me for reverting vandalism and removing spam  i had trouble with a spammer who added spam then get pissed because i removed it so he decided that since he couldnt have any external links that hed remove them alleven though there had been prior discussion about the one that was therethe only external link ive ever seen without advertisements    maybe you could watch the articles that i am constantly removing spam from  everyday websites with advetisements for prostitution are adding external links to wikipedia and i remove them as quickly as i find them but they keep coming back  why dont you watch those articles shithead    asshole    you fucking cocksucker  if im ever blocked again for removing spam or reverting vandalism i am going to be the one adding spam promoting prostitution to every article i can find  just to spite you asshole  without me these adultrelated articles would be nothing but external links and inarticle spam  got it asshole the preceding unsigned comment was added by user,0.0,No,0.0
