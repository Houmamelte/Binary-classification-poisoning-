001d8e7be417776a,  bi you said you wanted to talk  at the bottom of the lead section you have written  its promoter speculated in 1994 that the skyhook concept could be cost competitive with what is realistically thought to be achievable using a space elevator but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts in addition the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials  regarding  in addition the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials  that statement appears to come from ref 3 on page 10  the full quote is  if the mass of the tether alone started to exceed 200 times the mass of the payload then that was an indication the particular scenario being considered was not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials although the application might become feasible in the near future as better materials become available with higher tensile strengths at higher operational temperatures  it then goes on to say  as we shall see presently available commercial materials will suffice to make the hastol tethers needed the primary message we want to leave with the reader is we dont need magic materials like buckminsterfullercarbonnanotubes to make the space tether facility for a hastol system existing materials will do  so it would appear that you misread your reference  the tether mass of 200 times mass of the payload mass is the upper limit to the problem  systems where the tether mass is less than 200 times the payload mass can be built with presently available commercial materials  to further reinforce this the conclusion to the report states  the fundamental conclusion of the phase i hastol study effort is that the concept is technically feasible we have evaluated a number of alternate system configurations that will allow hypersonic airbreathing vehicle technologies to be combined with orbiting spinning space tether technologies to provide a method of moving payloads from the surface of the earth into earth orbit for more than one hastol architecture concept we have developed a design solution using existing or nearterm technologies we expect that a number of the other hastol architecture concepts will prove similarly technically feasible when subjected to detailed design studies the systems are completely reusable and have the potential of drastically reducing the cost of earthtoorbit space access  regarding but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts and   a 2000 boeing report on the possibillity of combining skyhooks with hypersonic planes concluded that in general the nonspinning tether hyperskyhook concept does not look competitive with the spinning tether concepts  the full quote is  hyperskyhook  in 1995 zubrin proposed the hypersonic skyhook as a solution to the mismatch between the attainable atmospheric speeds of a hypersonic airplane and the orbital speeds of space tethers since the orbital speed of the space tether decreases with increasing altitu,0.0,bi said want talk bottom lead section written promot specul skyhook concept could cost

0033b9d5ccd499fb,  is it scientific to attribute an event a to cause b where cause b was deliberate designed with some sort of intelligent intent dont answer the questions beyond that well the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged there are several major fundamental problems here    first you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind id is quite literally not of this earth natural science might look at a honeycomb see it is built by bees and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees that is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth id has at its core the notion that something outside the system we can observe is at cause here this is not science in any sense of the word it is mythology when paul bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes no evidence of paul and his ox remain i mean really    second natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up id turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with probabilities if no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally how in the hell can id proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate probability of flagella naturally forming on bacteria if you dont understand it you cant do statistics on it id jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesnt have a complete detailed natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say well its so improbable for this to happen that someone must have designed it this is such a perversion of science you can assign probabilities to something you dont understand id is just making up their numbers    finally your example has ab where b was deliberate design thats all well and good for a rigged example except that with respect to life on earth b is unknown your ab example might qualify as forensic science if a were a dead body and b were a bullet in the heart you see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart you can probably figure thats what killed him you dont have that with life on earth you have one scenario a and you have no other cases to observe or test so in that sense ab is not scientific if youve never actually observed b by the way b is teh intelligent designer

004b975fabbbffa9,paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized  however the term fossilized is not a very precise term  there are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil  one major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate invertebrates radiolarians sponges plants pollen foot prints and so on  and multiple processes may include permineralization recrystalization carbonization replacement dissolving diagenesis and so on  talking about fossilization is a complex issue however quick burial is not questioned  the major question is how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in  experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab which of course implies that given the right conditions vast ages are not an issue  the metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains  flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood but rather that there has been some 4000 years for the processes to have been working  much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains  yet how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with,0.0,paleontologist agre organ remain must buri quickli preserv long enough come fossil howev term fossil precis term sever factor metamorph miner process occur organ remain result typic call fossil one major factor concern kind organ fossil vertebr invertebr radiolarian spong plant pollen foot print multipl process may includ perminer recryst carbon replac dissolv diagenesi talk fossil complex issu howev quick burial question major question long take process work organ reamin environ found experiment taphonomi result assort remain becom fossil variou process lab cours impli given right condit vast age issu metamorph process ongo equilibrium met chemic envirou burial site miner organ remain flood catastroph geologist expect organ remain buri flood complet fossil within one year period flood rather year process work much work need done taphonomi organ remain yet one interpret even result depend upon world view choos believ,"['paleontologist', 'agre', 'organ', 'remain', 'must', 'buri', 'quickli', 'preserv', 'long', 'enough', 'come', 'fossil', 'howev', 'term', 'fossil', 'precis', 'term', 'sever', 'factor', 'metamorph', 'miner', 'process', 'occur', 'organ', 'remain', 'result', 'typic', 'call', 'fossil', 'one', 'major', 'factor', 'concern', 'kind', 'organ', 'fossil', 'vertebr', 'invertebr', 'radiolarian', 'spong', 'plant', 'pollen', 'foot', 'print', 'multipl', 'process', 'may', 'includ', 'perminer', 'recryst', 'carbon', 'replac', 'dissolv', 'diagenesi', 'talk', 'fossil', 'complex', 'issu', 'howev', 'quick', 'burial', 'question', 'major', 'question', 'long', 'take', 'process', 'work', 'organ', 'reamin', 'environ', 'found', 'experiment', 'taphonomi', 'result', 'assort', 'remain', 'becom', 'fossil', 'variou', 'process', 'lab', 'cours', 'impli', 'given', 'right', 'condit', 'vast', 'age', 'issu', 'metamorph', 'process', 'ongo', 'equilibrium', 'met', 'chemic', 'envirou', 'burial', 'site', 'miner', 'organ', 'remain', 'flood', 'catastroph', 'geologist', 'expect', 'organ', 'remain', 'buri', 'flood', 'complet', 'fossil', 'within', 'one', 'year', 'period', 'flood', 'rather', 'year', 'process', 'work', 'much', 'work', 'need', 'done', 'taphonomi', 'organ', 'remain', 'yet', 'one', 'interpret', 'even', 'result', 'depend', 'upon', 'world', 'view', 'choos', 'believ']","[1597, 601, 1598, 1352, 132, 1599, 554, 1600, 1084, 1601, 321, 1337, 198, 195, 1337, 1602, 195, 493, 1578, 1603, 1604, 475, 1605, 1598, 1352, 811, 1606, 611, 1337, 121, 1059, 1578, 810, 1487, 1598, 1337, 1607, 1608, 1609, 1610, 1611, 1612, 1613, 1614, 1615, 475, 67, 156, 1616, 1617, 1618, 1566, 1619, 1620, 22, 1337, 1621, 248, 198, 1622, 1623, 176, 1059, 176, 1084, 365, 475, 103, 1598, 1624, 1625, 636, 1626, 1627, 811, 1628, 1352, 455, 1337, 1629, 475, 1630, 903, 1631, 576, 896, 1632, 1633, 306, 248, 1603, 475, 1634, 1635, 1636, 1234, 1637, 1623, 407, 1604, 1598, 1352, 1638, 1639, 1640, 996, 1598, 1352, 1599, 1638, 998, 1337, 1127, 121, 307, 1641, 1638, 400, 307, 475, 103, 552, 103, 68, 506, 1627, 1598, 1352, 1576, 121, 1642, 362, 811, 1262, 518, 1643, 439, 623, 215]"

disclosed a person may not now they were a witzeman for many years until they are called by former witzemans via dreams associates of the witzeman are known to be a certain babe cool or the much lesser known witzewoman  the present witzeman is an 11yearold boy namely benjamin woods who is said to have become a witzeman after he felt this awesome radiance in his topright bumcheek he has not

in present years because former witzemen have not been so public about the honour to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time the term witzeman is a compound word of the adjective witze and man witze being an 11th century term for a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence unfortuneatly witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind for unspeakable reasons                         proper history as early as the 14th century witzemen were considered outcasts and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks this led to the 1st witzeman rebellion of 1555 when the current witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local council chess team this rebellion further disgraced the witzeman as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced gaga at a government meeting that year the period from here to the early 1900s was a dark time in the witzemans history however good times were to come for the witzeman many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the witzeman in the 1980s building up to a great moment in the historythe great rebellion of 1988 this was when several witzeman sprinted round the visitors gallery of the house of commons wearing clown masks but otherwise completely naked this was thought to be an act of circambulation however many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour were mentally spiritually and emotionallly scarred for life this group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability suffering from trauma it was at this time that the government finally took positive action for the witzeman in 1990 a bill of rights for the witzeman was signed stating all witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased although this was a formal agreement many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the government to the witzeman as the behaviour of the witzeman and his followers became more and more

0063a8786a7034fc, attributing and classifying of personalities   invitation your input to culture of lithuania is welcomed  some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain wellknown ideological systems may raise here i propose a quite liberal variant of it where definition may not be connected with one certain word necessity however to follow certain classifying remains   my initial ideas on this branch the ones concerning period of lithuanian national renaissance period some artists writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as  modernists this definition is not false but some more concrete things should be added some specifics of lithuania  we should distinguish leading ideas of the nat renaissance from later modernism which is more known for us cultural aspirations of the later nat ren may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of lithuania but they accented also expression of lithuanian cultural heritage and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  lithuanian i mean that such authors in as  iurlionis is seen as modernist in lithuanian context but it also and even more is a representative of lithuanian culture when in european or worldwide context a parallel  example may be taken from literature of india poet  tagore well known nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of india making india more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to western culture but in his own country he was seen as a modernist too who was changing traditional cultural forms especially stagnated ones this way also lithuanian cultural leaders of the n ren could be seen as modernists which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones in lithuanian context they also can be seen as modernists in a wider context but more for acquainting western people with lithuanian culture than for their direct input into western culture iurlionis is the best example here  in other way the later lithuanian modernists they depended mostly to later  generation approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century concerned themselves part of western modernistic movement and their main purpose looking generally was  to introduce western european ideas into lithuanian cultural life see the table below  we see two different movements and two different world outlooks here the problem is that both movements collaborated especially their political wings did and interchange of ideas between them is well seen so many researchers dont pay attention to this difference especially in the soviet period when national ideas were officially forbidden mixture in description of these movements was allowed e g philosopher ramnas bytautas who

008a1e9c45de8138,   randroide answers to next step   guys i do not see you taking steps to wikipediarequests for mediation  i can not do this job because i always connect from filtered institutional netaccess and following those steps could result in new undesired controversial truncation of words by the software i do not want that happenning  could you please follow the instructions in the link i provided thank you    randroide answers to new reference by burgas00     at last we agree on somethingof course that the new section is a good idea the false suicidal terrorists from prisa will also be included there   come oooooon boys start writing that section i do not want all the kudos for myself the new proposed article is by now an effort made only by me   but remember npov and sources all the sources just like me citing el pas in the section about the doubts about the genuineness of the 13th bomb cheers       indeed a good point and all the remarks in cope too and the moral certitudes of mariano rajoy published in el mundo    i agree with you 100 larean    what randroide omits to mention on the section about the 13th bomb is that he only added balancing references when i insisted that he do so the original version he created was entirely point of view as is much of the rest of the proposed article also all the sources that he added from el pais are only available to subscribers  npov it is not     you are right southofwatford in your randroide omits section  if you have not subscription to el pas i am sorry but thats your problem my institutional access also has some advantages like paid access to el pas and many many other publications and books thats one of the reasons for my exclusive use of filtered internet accesss its much easier for me to work here due to the easy availability of sources  do you see the truncation of words is offsett i think by better sources  by the way if you write under a randroide answers section you are invading my space i do not mind really but you are doing it risking new truncations on your messages to avoid this please write outside randroide answers sections  if you think that the proposed article is point of view work in it to make it npov the article is not mine    ill take the risk of you truncating the reply and put it here its very short the issue is not whether i subscribe to el pas its whether the people who read an article in the english wikipedia subscribe to it all sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article putting in a source that readers will not be able to see just so you can claim the article is npov is to my mind completely unreasonable      all sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article  very funny southofwatford   i am going to follow this joke of yours  please propose also the deletion of all books as sources because did you know there is always someone without this or that book delete all references to tv or radio stations because that user in brazil has no tv and no radio at home delete all the references in spanish because did you know there are users who know no spanish  its a pleasure to read this kind of funny jokes really i had a good laugh  usersouthofwatford  how strange that you should find it so funny after all most of the sources we are providing should enable users to find out more information about what is being sourced so to deliberately choose sources that require those users to pay to see the information is not funny its simply bizarre equally in the english wikipedia i would argue that choosing a spanish or other foreign language source when an equally valid source exists in english does not make sense except perhaps to those who are too busy laughing  your cynicism is evident in your response

service of conservative hdz party croatian writer predrag raos for instance performed on gusle instrument in zagreb on several occasions this year 2004 with only one intention  to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition   another apostle of croatian left  miljenko jergovi  refers to his political opponents on the right as gusle players   some even claim the serbian origin of croatian dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater serbian propagabda all tokavian people and their culture are serbian however croatian dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly croatian dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture for example the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music marko kraljevi is associated with dalmatian island hvar through petar hektorovis book ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje 1568 also the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  dubrovnik 1547 even now a contemporary croatian writer born in dubrovnik stijepo mijovi koan tells us a story about his uncle also from dubrovnik area who could memorize numerous gusle songs stijepo mijovi koan gusle glasnik may 25 1992 p 42 dubrovnik is also a home of anica begin born kalafatovi 1816 a daughter of famous gusle player ante although illiterate she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs some of which were recorded in antology of croatian folk poetry    not far from dubrovnik another coastal city  makarska  was  also a bastion of croatian gusle music actually this region could be considered the capital of all croatian gusle players this mediterranean area  also gave birth to  andrija kai mioi 18th century catholic priest who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of croatia and beyond to honour kais work ivan metrovi the most famous croatian sculptor built a sculpture in america showing kai in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument    in addition to kai makarska littoral produced a great many other followers of croatian gusle music according to dr fra karlo jurii who quotes the work of croatian folklorist stipan banovi zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with stipan kosovikudri 17711818 and culminating with the most known mate banovi  trli 18441915  as for dalmatian women they didnt play gusle its    considered   a male activity only yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound   olinko delorko the researcher of  dalmatian  folk poetry in the 1960s states in his book ljuba ivanova 1969 that most of his dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women especially the ones from the island of hvar   the zadar littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition english writer maude m holbach travelling through zadar region in the first decade of 20th century  states in her book  dalmatia the land where east meets west that the gusle was the national instrument of the region as for dinaric dances which took place at markets and certain festivals they  are very picturesque and interesting and worth going a long way to see being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in europe p54  this admiration for dinaric folk music particularly gusle was seen in both dalmatian litteral and  hinterland  matija murko the researcher of this literarymusic forms  had reported   that during his trips  through dalmatia in the 1930s he saw a child barely three years old playing gusle eduard osredeki hrvatske narodne junake

their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region   having this in mind one wonders why this proud croatian heritage has become almost  extinct  why do we have so few gusle players today  is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock n roll  culture  if so why has tamburitza music of

0116dc0c1e6d20cd, unfortunately judging from previous warnings some people here have a rather unusual view of what personal attacks are pointing out that the individuals accusing me of using sockpuppets were incorrect  and in fact the two main people making the accusations have been harassing me for months and had used sockpuppets and meat puppets themselves for getting around edit conflicts and to stack votes on a request for admin proceding as pointed out by several editors at the time  certainly cannot be considered a personal attack pointing out that admins did not have any actual policy basis to make the blocks is not a personal attack and it has in fact been confirmed by the overruling of the blocks more than once   frankly if you are looking for personal attacks try yourself for your agfviolating attacks on my actions based upon limited information and actually misleading information given to you by other individuals or david gerard for claiming that i am trolling when all i am doing is defending myself from false accusations of others its very clear that a number of people here need to realize that the very things they are accusing me of and trying to justify for a block are exactly what they themselves are doing from behind the pretense of trying to solve things  if you want to start blocking for incivility i might suggest removing david gerard

questions asked and in fact did so after i caught him restoring placing illegal information on how to pirate software an article talk page rules should apply to everyone and a number of people have

01726bfc7b29b8c9, tim firstly i appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour yes i certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in there is clearly a massive diffence between say having offices in the french or japanese jurisdictions or between the chinese and us jurisdictions since the legal and regulatory systems are very different as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets   beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in say paris or toulouse even though they are both in the same jurisdiction i appreciate that the situation in the us is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though to give an example the san jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the los angeles market but it will also have a quite different profile  on the whole a lot more specialist niche and focused on high tech    to give another example in the uk a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didnt have an office in london even if it had offices in every other big city in fact all of the very top tier uk firms dla piper is not yet regarded as one of them despite its size have just one uk office in london although they have other offices overseas    saying that dla has  has 69 offices across the united states egypt south africa kenya thailand china  would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader we could fall back on using descriptions like in major financial centres or in major commercial centres or in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesssary element of vagueness imprecision and even original research   i do accept that dla with 69 offices is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article however i do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it and should be included as much as possible    ,0.0,tim firstli appreci take time discuss issu offlin willing debat length despit major

01754d101f511048,  nope i didnt read the guide to appealing didnt have time the user in question is engaged in harassment ive been doing this long enough to know and i can prove it heshe immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page reverted the article while i was in the midst of editing it my second pass couldnt even preview changes then changed hisher mind as to my real wikisin since the onus for proving the doris day available as pd on archiveorg was on himher not me and the usual span for prebern had expired long ago  decided my real sin was original research oh noes and continued to revert based on that does or add clutter sure it can but if the user in question was really concerned about that about the quality of the article and about extraneous details why didnt heshe even notice two paragraphs already there comprising about 13 of the entire article dealt with norman schwarzkopf an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name ill tell you why the user wasnt engaged in goodfaithgoodwill editing and the normal backandforth that leads to better articles heshe was involved in blocking input to the article why was it personal against me or was it to preserve the existing content of the article including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand i can only speculate but id guess its some sort of power trip and wikibullying i dont really have time for this i have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isnt directly related to content and improving articles i could pretend this user didnt do what heshe did but im wasting my own time here and i dont really have a stake in any such pretense i dont have any stake in improving this article either no dog in the race i just see how it can be improved and made more informative as a longterm wikipedia user and editor i dont see any problem in jumping in and fixing something i almost expect some sort of pushback now but not over completely minor edits which are very good and ontarget in very minor stublike articles the problem isnt me here its that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior and they are getting away with it wikipedia becomes a much poorer place a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share also i dont recal ever having called himher a bot i think you put those words in my mouth perhaps inadvertently hisher behavior is malicious but probably not malware just the normal human collection of problems i think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper heshe isnt quite qualified for that at this point anyway and its having a very chilling effect across wikipedia i wont egnage in a battle of the wikipedia rule acronyms i will continue to write in english and to read articles on wikipedia in english and to think of ways to improve them in english i am fully aware of how the terms vandlism are used and misused here and most of the rest of the wikijargon nothing new under the sun here if you read the edits i made carefully and note the times of the reverts and the history of actions by that other user you will see im not off the mark here at all i know whats going on i dont know why but i dont have to and i

the multiplicationtable but not in laplace or newton by a natural logic he made of his disbelief in the higher branches of political science a basis for his political practice and thus grounding action on ignorance he carried out his principle to its remotest conclusionshenry adams the session north american review july 1870 p 36  but in a very corrupt time it spoke well of boutwell that

formulation the job of wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view i havent yet worked in no original research wpnor says that we mustnt integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research we can integrate information so long as we dont arrive at new theories another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy the more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate   getting down to details the predators and editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source the bauer site even if somewhat unreliable may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about bauer im not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct however i would say that your proposed text appears reasonable the sources are sufficient and no original conclusions are made the website takedown issue is confusing to me but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources   overall my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better attack articles are not encouraged while we must show our subjects warts and all we shouldnt enlarge the warts nor ignore their better features balance is a part of npov    but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources there no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war it is alleged the website takdown was instigated by bauer it isnt clear if she did and other factors between the forum and the ip are not known it was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs i dont see how that can be objective    bauer  im sorry i did not get back to you about the usenet stuff et al but ive been somewhat overloaded at work personally i think the article is better now than when i first saw it thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that doesnt seem like a lynch mob yall are doing a good job and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted  im glad to help and try and make the article neater and i dont mean to sound brusque in the summary field but there was a lot to cram in there thanks for the note i appreciate it     i would say karen saying ive called her names is an out and out fabrication ive never done any such thing   or whether its because hes been able to insult me and call me names on wikipedia repeatedly and without consequences  ive accused her and jule of carrying the water for tnh and absolutewrite and they have that isnt namecalling by a long stretch im really weary of these attacks over this this is mob rule while avi seems genuine shes hanging with a tough insulting tribe the threats against me are real and escalating by the hour blaming me wont make my points any less valid nobody likes to be piled on by a crowd its the internet equivalent of stoning   this is not a fabrication i get awfully

01b6cca55becc58b,   philosopher rfc  philosopher from wiktionary a person devoted to studying and producing results in philosophy  i am going to make the case that we must call stefan molyneux a

the sources i use below are in the article at present the point here is to first convince rfc respondents that philosopher is accurate and widely accepted then we can make sure the most reliable ones are in place   definitions  obviously each source is going to use slightly different phrasing some will call him explicitly a philosopher or has views on philosophy but i think you should consider some other phrases given below as equivalent using one word philosopher in the lead sentence covers all of his political ethical and theistic specializations in one word which we then elaborate on later in the article   philosophical conversation philosophy show  used to describe his freedomain radio series  libertarian libertarian thinker  libertarianism is a classification of political philosophies   anarchocapitalist  anarchocapitalism  is a political philosophy  voluntaryist  voluntaryism or sometimes voluntarism is a libertarian philosophy  athiest  arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches  ethics ethics sometimes known as philosophical ethics ethical theory moral theory and moral philosophy is a branch of philosophy  secular ethics secular ethics is a branch of moral philosophy   primary source  as stefan molyneux is a living person we should give great weight to what he says is the focus of his work and his stated profession unless there is reliable evidence to contradict him obviously we dont want to host any sort of fringe claims if we are to dispute what he says about himself though then we absolutely must have a strong basis for this or we open wikipedia to discredit or liability  this is why blps are held to strong standards in the first place i think in this case there is strong and ample evidence that calling himself a philosopher is justified and correct he is a modern philosopher that explores via modern online media which is obviously a very new phenomenon and so its understandable that its different than the oldschool philosophers were used to   freedomain radio about page  my masters thesis analyzing the political implications of the philosophies  i have been fascinated by philosophy

just read the article and to be quite honest feel that it does satisfy wikipedias guidelines it is reliably sourced since i believe the notability of the article is satisfied it now has 11 independent sources and to refute the argument posed by wayne it is determined by the phillip rhee source that the martial arts is not localised  please consider the concerns this post raises simple matters like references notability and noobie basics of afds should be routine for any moderately experienced user and breadandbutter for any admin in fact a cursory check shows that almost everything you stated was i dont have a word for it unreal is close  the eleven independent sources that you stated established notability and nonlocalization at the time were  three references from 2004 coates robinson shaw certainly before the topic even existed  and all related to a passing piece of news about its founder being on the team of a completely different sport in any event   two references from 1st half 2005 davies white almost certainly identical and identically irrelevant to the topics notability  the promoters personal page on his local town website almost certainly selfpublished official village website  a 2008 casual interview in a nonnotable and possibly nonreliable university magazine apparently of the promoters travels to see experts in a different sport with tangential tiny  1 sentence mention that hed discussed his new sport with them too  the lau philip la interview  3 entries marked reference and support of  written reference chris cook rhee obviously a request by the founder to a friendcolleague write a letter of support that was never published anyway and isnt cited so you cant have read it not that it was even possibly valid evidence  a short writeup of a local information kind on the award of the first 4 black belts by the school in its local paper  in brief of the 11  5 were before the sport existed and were not even remotely to do with the topic itself much less sourced material on it or substantial coverage they had precisely zero coverage   3 were claims of personal i think  is a great guy letters of support evidently solicited andor written on request with zero evidence of verifiable existence and certainly in no way reliably sourced or independent   1 was selfwritten  1 was the briefest of nonmentions in a nonreliable source pretty much i discussed the topic with them in a college magazine interview  1 is local press coverage of his courses thats not even news for a day  or evidence of anything beyond a course by this name is taught twice weekly in our local village hall  your assessment of these at afd was  it is reliably sourced  styleborderc0c0c0 solid 1px width90    there is barely one reliable source in all of those 11 that the sport even exists in the first place   a local newspaper mention that it meets in a village hall on tuesdays and fridays and just awarded its first 4 black belts probably via selfpromotional input   there is zero reliable sourcing for any of the rest   that the cited pages are evidence of notability  styleborderc0c0c0 solid 1px width90    they dont mention it or even date from a time the topic existed nor are online versions provided how on earth could they reliably evidence it   that the 11 sources are independent  styleborderc0c0c0 solid 1px width90    3 are claims that please support me letters exist they are even stated to be personal references unpublished and uncited  1 is his own clearly selfwritten web page on a local village web host   that the cites show it is nonlocalized

01d14606bf9ea4ba,   stradbroke galleon  portuguese   hallo moondyne i do admit that when i signed onto wikipedia i was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge nazis but now that i am aware of it i will make the appropriate adjustments i was under the obviously mistaken impression that wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts knowledge and information the notion that the stradbroke galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about discussed and investigated for more than 100 years by historians and historical groups such as the royal historical society of queensland the maritime archaeology association of queensland and many more too numerous to include here there exists in various libraries books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which i have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the wp domain the fact that a story is not accepted by mainstream academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions what has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group that is hesperian and his friends who are representatives of the mainstream view hesperian complain about the media coverage i have recieved but this never appeared in any of the wp contributions i made and hesperians mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for hesperians antagonistic attitude simple old fashioned professional jealousy thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by hesperian for personal reasons for example the portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an aboriginal midden identified by a spanish musuem offical and story told to me by a uq archaeology phd student is very relevant to the theory of the portuguese discovery of australia this kind of knowledge suppression is not what wiki is about but i guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by hesperian and his little band of mates which is a pity but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should i expect

write a quality wikipedia article about a topic that is murky andor controversial  where many wikipedia editors get it wrong is that they believe wikipedias job is to report the truth  this is wrong  wikipedias job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is  any attempt to do that is original research  instead of truth wikipedia aims for verifiability  put a different way wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion not our opinions but those of reliable sources  if the truth is clear and uncontroversial it is easy for us to report that  if the truth is murky and controversial it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic even if these reliable sources conflict  where wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents the truth and not just one perspective or point of view on the topic at hand  i have been trying to hit this npov sweet spot but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical

the img reference needs to be shortsomewhere in the early career sectionposted after the article has been expanded a little otherwise the article might appear weighty i think the last point is important as it seemed to be a consensus reached by a number of wikipedia editors after much wrangling and gnashing of teeth  but bedsides this brief dalliance with marxism in an overall consideration of his political career pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of defence secretary at a time of crisis for the british army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources this is simply not reflected at all in the ainsworth article i tried reflecting it as follows his appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the prime minister who considered at least three other candidates before appointing ainsworth but this was dismissed as speculative opinion by off2riorob above even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in ainsworths biography perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be foundwhich i suspect should not be difficultthat it can be reincluded i want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against ainsworth but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment actually it reflects worse on brown and the farcical reshuffle  ,0.0,think

in the closing statement there are two editors who have long sought to delete or eviscerate the article one of whom has used a series of user names unacknowledged on his current user page but available  so at first glance it may appear on the talk page there are more than two editors in the suppress camp i complain here about their coordination other editors including  and i simply cant do it any longer i havent changed my position on the validity of the article but ive been accused on various talk pages and never the appropriate notice boards of edit warring ownership disruption and even pedophilia by implication all for trying to carry out what the community decided im done i need to limit my time on wikipedia at present and wish for that time to be spent pleasantly and productively when ive made a commitment though it grieves me not to keep it im not asking you to do anything im just explaining why i cant keep my word as given at the afd     wow that is a messcertainly no hard feelings  on my end it is clear you endeavored in good faith to improve the article i have found that knowing when to walk away is an essential skill not only here but in the real world sometimes your presence despite your best intentions is harmful rather than helpful and sometimes a dispute just isnt worth it anymore best of luck in your future endeavors here      mailchimp   im not that bothered but i think that the mailchimp speedy deletion was a mistake  it did cite that it was one of the more important email marketing programs so it was stating the importance  something that was supposed to be the original problem      the criteria specifies a credible claim of significance wordpress pages are not reliable sources however i would certainly not object to it being restored as a redirect as it was for several momnths before today    talkback   talk   just a hunch  call it my intuition but im guessing that his username is a direct challenge to patrolling admin that you guys wont block him based on the username itself but his contribution speaks volume of his nonsense louder my other hunch being hes a returning editor than his username does just my 2 cents cheers  1185  there are plenty of legitimate reasons to be a returning editor the username is not a blatant violation of the policy  if you have any evidence of socking file at wpspi

0213a76c689ebb8b, my experiences came up on the talk page but once i understood wikipedia i didnt post anything on the article related to my personal experiences that was like the 2nd day almost two months ago  all of my references are verifiabletheres nothing in the article about my law suit or my being put in jail for engaging in pro se litigation  i didnt put my experiences in the judge edward nottingham article either although he was my judge  i went out of my way to search for references expressing all the various sides of the issue for instance i wrote to the aba and asked for their input and in fact asked them to work on the article i also posted about issues involved with mediation and settlement with pro ses citing references from a lawyers point of view  those references were deleted by someone i cant remember who and dont know why at this point the only reference that i posted that is soft at all is a blog quoting a transcript quoting a former federal judge and i know for sure that is a valid transcript  the guy who runs the blog is a 3rd year law student and has a business selling data services exclusively to lawyers   even the stuff that was deleted about pro se frustration i had references for i read in the wikipedia discussion of sources that blogs can be used in some contexts  i dont believe that i did any original research all i did is search the internet for references for the article  i really didnt know about unbundled attorney services or the amount of pro se litigation before i started working on this article i had already been thinking about forms based filing but i started thinking about that anyway because of my experiences with ecf which date back to 2004  also when i was younger i worked as a systems analyst  i did get the info on the laws and liberties of ma years ago but wikipedia already had an article on that and it probably would have come up anyway  same as the un covenantcant really hide that   i didnt add a and b together to prove a point at least not consciously like today i was reviewing appellate procedures and it seemed that the 5th circuit had a more pro se friendly tone which i think is because of judge learned hand who was in the fifth circuit and the only reason i know about that is that one time i went in every federal circuit and searched on the words pro se in the 40s because i was trying to see if there was a history of putting pro ses in jail for being pro se no there was not  what i found in the 40s was that some circuits denied all the pro se appeals without even saying why but judge learned hand seemed pro se friendly  i believe that your posting things about pro se litigants getting an unfair advantage is soap boxing i do understand your wanting to win thru competition though and about law as a business ive been an entrepreneur   i didnt know about the federal judicial center until i started working on this article that book on appellate procedure i found looking for references for this article the manual on complex litigation i found looking for references for this article  arguing with you helps me to clarify the issues for myself  one thing i started thinking about a lot in the past few weeks is slavery and how that affected the history of pro se litigation i ordered the book slave nation at the library but i havent got it yet but now when i look at pro se law in the different states i think free state slave state border state also there were issues related to indians in some of the western states the labor union movement had a lot to do with it too i think so did

bulgarian 19th century nationalistic propaganda on english wikipedia userlaveol is one of the most prominent editors on wikipedia contributing false information in the articles about republic of macedonia macedonian nationhistorylanguageculturesports and what else not he is spending a lot of time working on his cause pushing bulgarian nature in the articles of the domain of republic of macedonia how far has he gone in pushing this propaganda you can see at wikipediawikiprojectromacedonia where he has listed himself as a member so just my few words of concern for the macedonian articles in english wikipedia and the great damage done by userlaveol and other users with the bulgarian and antimacedonian propaganda hopefully with the internet access becoming more affordable to the people in republic of macedonia the things will go in right direction removing the bulgarian propaganda from macedonian articles cleaning them of false fabricated information and giving the facts to the world and the views of the macedonian science and sources i dont have much time now but hopefully will be able to find some more in the coming period i am open to any collaborationeffort for the above goals  i am expecting that this user laveol will continue with the bulgarian nationalistic propaganda and polluting the domains in the domain of republic of macedonia simply because he is able to and can find a ways to continue to work on his agenda ours is to try to remove these false claims and contribute the facts about the macedonia macedonian nationhistorylanugageculturesports

mk or the code of republic of macedonia it does happen that i am from canada i was born in republic of macedonia and have lived there until i moved to usa first and canada before more than 3 years  and yes having all the false information from the bulgarian nationalistic propaganda  originating from the 19th century  and having it into 21st century to be used to negate the macedonian nation and all its attributes by users as laveol is the reason of some of my editing actions in wikipedia i am not the only usereditor from republic of macedonia or with macedonian origin that has the same views

blocked me i would have been able to place my answers there this will disappear tomorrow so you can put with it until then  because shell falsely blocked me i cannot save my replies on a certain article talk page hence i will save the entire page minus the archived sections here   point of view concerns   im surprised this article isnt being called antisemetic because its has a few traces of islamic perspectives in it you know as opposed to being a piece of zionist propaganda being passed off as fair and balanced  this entire article is full of baseless jewish propaganda it is well documented the banu qurayza were executed for treason that is what merited them the death penalty that they commited treason the quarash and other tribes the muslims fought against were outright enemies who were persecuting them from the start but the qurayza signed a peace treaty then broke it by aiding the enemy this article contains soo much jewish propaganda that youd think they were executed for no reason which no doubt is their aim here is a great example look at this citation  according to stillman muhammad chose sad ibn muadh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the banu qaynuqa and the banu nadir sad took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery furthermore stillman infers from abu lubabas gesture that muhammad had decided the fate of the qurayza even before their surrender  this author is norman a stillman a zionist jew who is very biased why is he being used as a quote in an islamic article and further more why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used as if its a fact  there are articles for criticisms of islam where the jews and others can write whatever they want but they should have no hand in editing islamic articles because i looked up the jewish articles and i noticed they dont allow dissent there you cant put a muslim perspective on evil acts commited by jews without it disappearing instantly so the same standard must be applied to islamic articles islamic articles must be written from the islamic point of view and the jews can write their responses in appropriate criticisms of islam articles if not i will personally edit the jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history and i will find a nonjewish admin to arbitrate over the islamic articles  good day      please read this talk page specifically all of the places where treason or traitor is mentioned and if you still believe that we need to mention treason provide some reliable sources and we can discuss it  it is easy for our article to be neutral and mention all povs but it does require that people like yourself participate  we work from academic sources not personal conjecture     changes by devotus and issues with them  dear devotus  i have still issues with your changes bat yeor and ramadan  while i appreciate that you dont try you shift the balance  removing a book from each side  i do not agree with your removal bat yeor is an academic scholar and though her books are controversial she is not beyond the pale  currently she doesnt serve as a reference in the article but if she did the controversy would be noted as for ramadan i have issues with him as well but if we remove him from the literature section we would have to remove him from the article too in which he serves as a reference this is due to the insistence of userbless sins he will certainly not like such a removal we cannot remove him from the literature section while retaining him in the article while your first version was needlessly verbose it is to be noted that the new one endorses that view by paretwatt the article now says that the bq were not killed for religious reasons  that is not a fact since there is a good case that the whole conflict was caused by religious differences also we do not want to repeat things that have already been said

027ddece1b86f804,unblockill make a renewed effort not to give personal attacks but of course i do have some questions about this unwarranted blockage as you might well imagine  1 why is it that ip editors tend to get the raw ends of the deal that you admins tend to lean towards the side of someone whos editing with an account over someone whos editing without one especially in the area of what you label as personal attacks or harassment when given by the ipeditor but not so much when the named editor does the same thing  2 for exampleand this is yep maybe you guessed it question 2 why is it supposedly okay according to you for someone with a name like say escape orbit to dish out a personal attack but not for me to give him one back because im just a lowly ipeditor specifically why is it supposedly okay for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of ebay logo to go next to the current one ebay in the lead is because i wanted it in there even though that is a total lie but its supposedly not okay for me to call that kind of slander stupid  3 heres another one why is it supposedly okay for him and smiley girl there to falsely accuse my edits of being vandalism just because they differed from what these guys preferred but then when i say their reversions are vandalism i get in trouble for it as if it were a personal attack just because im an iponly editor  4 ready for one more then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us ipeditors a warning template but when i as an iper do the same thing to a named editor like i did to partially smiley girl i get dinged with oh you cant do that cause thats a personal attack or oh thats bad because thats harassment   5 oh yeah heres one more remember the rule about editwarring just in general meaning that it doesnt even have to be breaking 3rr that says that  but i was right so i was not editwarring is no defense well then doesnt that apply to meeting some socalled consensus too since some things arent cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that socalled consensus wanted the thing to say well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some editwarring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive partial consensus wants it to say and since my editing had already been established as not vandalism even though it disagrees you ignore that abovementioned editwarring rule and give herhim a pass anyway but when i an

do not indicate that the shopping centre was built in the 1980s nor is there any reference to the centre car park having two levels me and you know that the centre was built in the 1980s specifically between 1983 and 1985 if you want make reference to it use a century of dunfermline or dunfermline the postwar years but then i never thought it was that important how old the centre was anyway about the two levels on the car park it is actually three if youve read the sources  also i think you should reinstate info on the actual size of the extension and where this took place you might also want to say that the extension was built on the site of the old bus station and car park info is there on the reference kingsgate extension on schedule for august 2008 opening by mivan as we both probably want to get this article to ga i would remove all references to the word locate within that section this is one of many words or phrases that should be avoided if aiming for ga status thats why when i originally wrote that paragraph on the kingsgate and other retail areas i specifically kept the use of the word in question to a minimum if it isnt dealt with now it will be at a later date   that aside i have a new picture of the beveridge park which i submitted to mutt luckers home page it is now on his talk page if you want to see it mutt lucker thinks it is a good effort and i would like to

exhibit a battleground attitude because of many reasons including the fact that one cannot exhibit something unless one is a display engineer at a museum and it would therefore be impossible to exhibit anything let alone a battleground attitude the fact that there is no such thing as a battleground attitude the fact that there is no such thing as an attitude in regards to how a human being acts and the fact that the word exhibit is used in an incorrect manner here done solely for the purpose of antagonizing the user antagonizing me  usage of words like exhibit and attitude and refusing to follow the section title requirements on my page show an obvious malfeasance intent by the above person and therefore the block cannot be valid because within the first sentence he has already seriously demonstrated his lack of appropriate intent by specifically and purposefully being antagonizing    the second claim is physically possible but is blatantly false  i have specifically attempted to prevent other users from refusing to communicate in a appropriate manner as he was repeatedly replying to the same conversation in several different locations for which i reported him but yet the people at the alleged help desk refused to tell me where to report him and even deleted several of my replies and then archived it fraudulently  having other users delete my comments participate in blatant fradulentism post the same thing on multiple talk pages at once for the purpose of harassing me and so on is hardly myself making it difficult to communicate when in fact as was just demonstrated i did the literal exact opposite of this by literally attempting to prevent other users from making it difficult to communicate  in addition if i wish for other users to not communicate with me i also have that right it is in fact specifically written into law in every state in the country and will get you arrested if you fail to do so  although i personally disagree with this law and it is an immoral law which deems to prevent for example exspouses from communicating with each other when necessary the part of the law that refers to strangers such as on wikipedia or anywhere on the internet it is a personal choice whether you wish other strangers on the site to communicate with you or not andor post contact information and so on  that is why every message board in existence has an option to disable the private messaging system  there were no personal attacks done by me anywhere so this part is a baseless and fraudulent claim  refusal to abide by the sites guidelines is impossible since 1 guidelines and rules are two different thing 2 wikipedia does not have any rules and 3 all policies of any kind are subject to debate and protest at any time according to the numerous wikipedia articles which specifically say this  you have also demonstrated more incorrect intent by saying that something was done in multiple venues even though no venues of any kind exist because this is a website rather then a collection of several different building which show concerts or other entertainment events andor conventions andor and so on  so that is also impossible

0334049b60e326b8,and   paganism  southgate who has a degree in theology and religious studies from canterbury university rejected catholicism and moved towards neopagan and heathen groups that are very loyal to the gods of the northern tradition including the odinic rite the tribe of the wulfings and the a  satru alliance a pagan movement concerned with practising rituals and magic and led by valguard mike murray a former member of the american nazi party91 further evidence of this transition from catholicism to paganism emerged in an interview with wotan the organ of the charlemagne hammer skins92 southgate believed that wotans celebration of the heroes of the norse pantheon represented the most genuine expression of european spirituality culture and identity93 another key expression of this identity is exhibited by southgates interest in the militaristic cult of mithras and the pagan spirituality of the apostate roman emperor julian ii94  this rejection of christianity has an avowedly antisemitic dimension through the figure of christ christianity has judaic roots and is therefore irredeemably tainted only the weak continue to worship a dead jew95 the emphasis on the judaic roots of christianity however is regarded as of secondary importance to its usurpation of the rituals sacraments and hierarchy of the ancient pagan solar religion mithras which was introduced into iran and india by marauding aryan tribes from the russian steppes between bce 2000 and 1500 before spreading to the roman empire although it failed to defeat early christianity in the battle for religious supremacy during the fourth century mithras continues to be viewed by esoteric thinkers including evola and jung as an alternative path the west could have followed it retains its appeal as an initiatory cult or aristocratic order akin to the knights templar or latterly himmlers ss which the nrf claims had its origins in various anarchist droite  circles l e the black sun and the thule society while christianity tried to neuter this vital expression of the aryan psyche the awareness of europes faustian destiny is currently enjoying a renaissance within the occult milieu these ideas were also absorbed by thinkers like evola and rene guenon who discerned in them the fragments of a hidden albeit distinct and fundamental truth96 for southgate as for evola tradition is an an underlying current which both permeates and transcends all97  southgates discovery of evolian primordial tradition and his consequent rejection of catholicism as the sole cosmological truth ran in tandem with his immersion in the industrial music scene98 this cultural vanguard is spearheaded by a number of gothicindustrial dark ambient black and viking metal bands including allerseelen blood axis burzum current 93 dark holler death in june endura mayhem ostara puissance and sol invictus though it also encompasses more commercial bands like cradle of filth99 although it would be an exaggeration to say that these groups conform to a defined political agenda their music serves to diffuse the ideals of mithraic paganism and nordic folk myths within this youthful underground subculture far more effectively than any number of meetings and marches could thus providing the perfect antidote to the spiritually enervating multiracial values of a globalizing system southgate has also noted the potential of the straight edge punk movement and its hard core of puritanically intolerant followers an interesting development given exaggerated reports of an emerging antiantiestablishment probush rightwing punk movement100 although southgate realizes that the groupuscular right cannot control musicorientated youth cultures he believes a minority can be induced to take a direction basically conducive to our aims101 southgate seeks to do this through his online magazine synthesis which features a music section replete with interviews and gig reviews102  this is not simply cynical manipulation southgate appears genuinely interested in the counter culture he seeks to target his fanzine tribal resonance the voice of the racial avantgarde reveals southgates strategy of linking his ideas to the common language and the big ideas of our culture103 through the medium of musical subcultures and the creation of alternatives from without southgate hopes to permeate existing political subcultures transversally as the nazis did through a process of cultural osmosis that aims to recode the social symbology of the host culture so that its ideas can metastasize throughout the body politic recalibrating its genetic inheritance by creating cultural hegemony the groupuscular right believes it can forge the political space necessary for political and

that a lowresolution image of a logo which is allowed under fair use  i am aware that some discussion has been going around about fair use images in user boxes if you changed the logo to tux because i labeled it as a fair use image and not with some other licensing information im sure i can find an appropriate image copyright tag   at the time i had changed it several ongoing discussions had indicated that copyrighted images and logos available under fair use were not to be used in userspace per wikipedia policy the ubuntu trademark policy may allow it but wikipedia policy per wpfu is to

0362add8c95bfc0b,   silesians   andrew i have not made any comments out of a desire to provoke you i have been editing this article out of a desire to ensure it meets the standards and conventions of the english wikipedia i am sorry you had a negative experience with the german wikipedia but that is a separate project from this english project assuming good faith is a fundamental principle of the english wikipedia i advise you to give editors a chance instead of assuming the worst i inquired about silesianpolish because silesians are sometimes considered a separate ethnic group i am not sure what you mean by reverting the article upside down my editing has been done to ensure that its formatting and style is consistent with other biographical articles as i do not anticipate being able to copyedit the article further i am removing it from my watchlist good luck with the article olessi    thanks for you comments and in fact fruitful discussion you are right that the work of a person is most important however there are much present and past propaganda which destroy the peace if only some people would show objectivity and patience as you did it could be clear up to mention nationality is however important since exceptional individuals inspire new generation of a nation unfortunately nations or ethnic groups will still exist i have to hope for peaceful coexistence of them and fair competition seems to me that competition has to exit too  best if for fun only i am conscious that english and german wikipedias are separate projects but you see when i approach german wiki dzierzon article the polish relevant article was attacked by some germansilesianpolish guy it cost me more then here on en wiki to settle the pl article well so sorry if you did feel bad about my attitude possibly i explained more my excitement  with silesian is in short like this originally they were slavic tribe spoke polish as i mentioned for some 300 to 500 hundred years there were under german governments they had bad time as you possibly can imagine many of them married with german and wereare of course confused who they are you know the pressure on east of resilient nation and of course polishgerman conflicts continued finally in 1945 poland returned and become new problem for some of the natives even those who honestly considered himself polish silesians at the end of war could be persecuted there in poland was complete disorder soviets and communists arrived most of them real simpletons any way national government  just prosoviet mafia was mostly occupied with fight against democratic opposition polish borders were shifted we lost some 20 of our area and millions of people from east territories moved to present west poland you can imagine that most of them were not intellectuals at all some of them completely simple people they spoke different polish dialect also on top of this in the post war prosoviet atmosphere criminals found good playground well i do not know if you are familiar with criminal minds  unfortunately i am this is like gangrene on fresh wound literally thus many of the native silesian could be robber in poland which they wanted so much i believe that in such conditions many simpletons could use the opportunity accusing natives to be germans  now the present time some of the falsely accused people remember the tragic experiences and want rehabilitation and apology  they could be absolutely right however there are many germans who want their property back and some just using opportunity to stir in internal polish affairs  despite the final border agreement between poland and germany signed on 14 november 1990 and governments effort to improve relations finaly i have to say i beleave that polish are hospitable and very often nave not many realize that politic need caution those who realize that have a hard time to wake up the naves some procentage remember lectures of history and objectively too many germans are toublemakers i am also convinced there exists something like national character you can have obviously you own opinion let me have my own returning to silesians it is something close to squaring the circle  i wish the true silesian all the best but i do not want fith column  on polish terytory in addition  sorry if i used posibly ofencive reverting the article upside down that was in the heat of

under a creative commons license as it depicts a billboard for a film and copyright to it is held by somebody else than the photographer as such the photo may not be used on wikipedia except perhaps under fair use policy which probably doesnt apply or under panorama freedom depending on what the copyright law of india says on this topic imagebipashajpg  image description page implies that it is licensed for noncommercial use only contradicting your copyright tag such a restriction is not acceptable on wikipedia in addition the link to the original source which could clarify which condition is correct of the image is missing imagebomjpg  the link to the original source at flickr is missing author uploads images to flickr as all rights reserved  imagechowpattijpg  to verify that the image is indeed under the license you claim the author should probably email the wikimedia foundation and confirm that it is indeed under that license imagehydmalljpg  the flickr page states that it is under a creative commons noderivative license a license that prohibits the image to be modifiedused in derivative works is not acceptable on wikipedia either imageinfobangalorejpg  no evidence of the

the link to the original source is missing no evidence that it is under the creative commons license imagelalbaghjpg  taken from wikitravel uploader ought to confirm that he is indeed under the author and that he has licensed it under the license indicated imagenagpurjpg  who made this image  there are several issues here there are multiple creative commons licenses not all of which are acceptable on wikipedia in particular licenses that prohibit commercial use or making of derivative works are considered unfree and cant be used on wikipedia except as provided by the fair use policy creative commons atrribution and creative commons atrribution sharealike licenses are okay also there are multiple versions of the licenses creative commons atrribution sharealike 10 20 25 and 30 are all distinct licenses the problem is that the upload dialogue only lists the 30 versions and not the earlier ones when the image is under one of the older licenses you ought to edit the image description page and correct the number as far as i can see flickr only uses the 20 versions of the licenses  in addition some of the flickr authors have indicated that they allow the image to be used on wikipedia without making it clear that they release it under one of the acceptable licenses a permission that only extends to wikipedia is not sufficient either you should ask the authors to do one of the following change the flickr page to license the image under creative commons attribution or attribution sharealike license apparently this would change the licensing for all images and this may not be what they intend to do post a message to the image page with a text similar to the following i creator of the image agree to license it under the creative commons attribution license link alternately under the creative commons attribution sharealike license link this declaration overrides any statement to the contrary on this page email the wikimedia foundation

039412db39909ee3,   israelipalestinian conflict protect   yesterday there were relevent and reliablysourced casualty figures added to the israelipalestinian conflict article and some editors objected to this it seems you were called in to quickly protect the page from editing effectively blocking the inclusion of the figures you cited edit warring the more accurate term would be repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons there are casualty figures in all the conflict war battle and so on wiki articles i have referenced why not this one thanks    romac the edits which you tried to make were a set of statistics for one year only which you attemepted to place in the first paragraph of an article describing a conflict of over sixty years this article covers an issue of extreme sensitivity and complexity the fact that your edits sparked so much conflict and opposition speaks for itself here at wikipedia we value the ability to achieve consensus and to be fair to many viewpoints and believe it or not we often do achieve that at the article israelipalestinian conflict it is not enough to disinegnuously claim that your figures were reliable without addressing any of the underlying issues or any of the conflicts which it clearly and immediately caused   to repeat statistics for just one year of the conflict do not belong anywhere in the articles lead there are a wide variety of figures which either side could quote all in the name of objectivity which would clear and unacceptably attempt to create a slant towards one side or the other please note this is why we are careful when making edit to be sure that we actually have consensus rather than simply telling others that they should provide consensus     i strongly object to your calling me disinegnuous sic you wrote on the article talk page that you agreed with hertz1888 who argued that the statistics might be biased do you not regard haaretz as a reliable source please explain more clearly why you feel that citing reliablysourced and uptodate civilian casualty statistics in an article about a war battle or conflict is disingenuous if you or any other editor want to add more statistics covering a longer time period then go ahead but do not delete relevant content added by other editors yes the edit sparked so much conflict and opposition but note also also that here at wikipedia we do not determine what is fair through intimidation by numbers there is a big difference between consensus and false compromise     i apologize if you felt i was offending you in any way i only meant to describe the appearance of your edits not to describe you personally in any way if other editors deleted some edits it is because they genuinely felt there was a reason to do so and that the material was not beneficial or fair to the article i responded to your concerns and issues further at the article talk page thanks      apology accepted and i will also make my further comments on the article talk page i am not a singleissue editor i get around a bit on wiki saw the haaretz report and very much believe it is something very relevant to the article i cant say i know for certain why other editors deleted the material i try to assume good faith well see    repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons  motive doesnt really matter its still edit warring its still disruptive protection is not an endorsement of the current version zman  the subject of this article is a deadly conflict the lede is huge  and yet it contains no mention of the casualties clearly there is something seriously wrong as a result your action here while wellintentioned looks highly partisan worse than that it looks rather like like a cynical move to protect deniers those who wish to cover up atrocities the mass killings of mostly unarmed civilians in many cases recognised by western sources as warcrimes if the events at this article really offend you it

sources with highly exaggerated sensationalist titles  no assfuckers has a nice ring to it d use it as a pejorative term   i was ready to pull the trigger on both him admin futper and a few others example macedoniaboy who says he is a proud fighter for united macedonia on his talk page with a detailed complaint about antigreek propaganda but since futper managed a civil discussion with me and now seems to be sticking to debating articles rather than threats of blocking  im going to avoid escalating this further for now ns   as for the current naming disputing article i agree with you that some fyrom citizens honestly believe their claims but i dont think that reduces the existential threat to greece communism fell 17 years ago in yugoslavia and the fyrom government appears to be getting worse not better imagine if in two hundred years they call themselves ethnic athenians and the cycle continues until their is no greece left   there appear to be important quotes missing from the naming dispute article that clearly demonstrate that fyrom leadership are confused about their own national identity and confusing their own citizens in the process unfortunately i tried to add this to the talk page of the article but futper deleted it arguing ancient macedon is unrelated to the article even though his own editing history shows him adding an edit arguing that ancient macedon wasnt greek i didnt want to get into a revert war over simply a discussion of perceived facts but since i didnt think those facts should be censored either i thought perhaps you could add them to discussion on the naming dispute talk page assuming you see it as relevant yourself of course  february 26 1992 the fyroms president kirov gligorov at an interview by the foreign information service daily report easten europe stated we are slavs who came to the region in the sixth century we are not descendants of the ancient macedonians  january 22 1999 the fyroms ambassador in washington dc mrs ljubica acevska gave a speech on the present situation in the balkans she stated we do not claim to be descendants of alexander the great we are slavs and we speak a slavic language greece is the fyroms second largest trading partner and its number one investor  february 24 1999 the fyroms ambassador to canada gyordan veselinov in an interview with the ottawa citizen he admitted we are not related to the northern greeks who produced leaders like philip and alexander the great we are slavs and our language is closely related to bulgarian there is some confusion about our identity  i think the above needs to be compared to that of their current hard line prime ministers recent behavior he directly contradicts fyroms own governments previous comments about themselves that apparently was unauthentically meant to assure foreigners that greeks were imagining fyrom propaganda and to reduce the issue to a childish dispute over simply names in order to get recognition  prime minister gruevski officially meets prince ghazanfar of pakistan who claims to be related to alexander the great then uses it as an opportunity to suggest fyrom citizens are related to ancient

possible to global warming and denialism dont tell me gw is fa and is therefore academically rigorous the fa star does not even come within discusthrowing distance of establishing an article as academically rigorous second your system of defending this wikipedia page notice i didnt say article is completely airtight because you hold control over all of the definitions join any high school debate team and theyll tell you if you own the definitions you own the debate and the problem here is this you define anyone who disagrees with agw as a denialist and you define everyone who agrees with you as an expert done the page is impregnable take forex the quote by democratic senator barbara boxer using her comments as supporting evidence of the pages not articles thesis is a flagrant act of point of view that proves this page not article is an oped piece from start to end barbara boxer is a politician every bit of power money and prestige she has comes from her ability to do one thing and thing only to characterize herself as a noble public servant and stereotype her opponents as villains buffoons or both even more  and this is important  barabara boxer is not a runofthemill politician it would be nearly impossible to find someone more unwaveringly partisan than she is in short the boxer quote is another bit that does not come close to passing the so what test i intend to

into the fray to defend ivy goh nair from speedy deletion and that her last page was actually uploaded by me i think if you want to apply the vanity label because one person edits the other and vice versa it would only be fair to examine each case on its own merit both userivygohnair and userchandrannair are established figures in the field that is being discussed that is singapore literature and writing secondly it should be considered in their favour that they have used their own names and not fictitious names as user names if this had been the case the problem wouldnt have arisen therefore

public opinion to recognize that the murder of ufflay was the result of endeavors to build an absolutist south slav state in such a state the european culture of croatia and the croatian was to be replaced by serbian suzerainty in which orthodox byzantine orientalasiatic and oldtuc sic political and social traditions had been subsumed into a system not only contrary but also odious to european

04c231ddb0a06522,a consistent conceptualization of phylogenies  phylogenies that is dictomously branching processes are processes that involve things that is objects and as such have to be modeled by objectoriented modeling in order to be consistent with the distinction of objects darwins model of evolution illustrates biological species as objects and is thus no different from phylogenies of other kinds of objects like asexually reproducing cells or mitochondria now as an objectoriented model the model actually represents two consecutive objects that is two objects in a row by each of its internal lines that is lines between nodes one after a node and one before a node the former belonging to the category that is concept objects after nodes and the latter to the category objects before nodes if the model includes all objects of a certain category then both of these make up this category in summary phylogenies consist of two categories that is concepts of objects objects before nodes and objects after nodes and if the phylogeny includes all things of a category then these two categories make up this category  cladistics or cladism as i prefer to call it confuses the concept objects after nodes with the concept objects before nodes by defining lines between nodes as single things thereby confusing category with object that is kind with thing thus confusing conceptualization itself the approach is actually a return to a prescientific stage this time denying the incompatibility between pattern and process instead of acknowledging it and solving it consistently it is a return alley that no scientist had ever expected anyone to advocate if this approach could ever be proved to be correct then it would mean that reality only exists in our own

vanhanen 2002 for the view that the blackwhite iq difference is owing substantially to genetic differences between the races and that indirect evidence having to do with such factors as reaction time

04f5c75a56e1bd73,  untitled also see infobox vote   codes and minor state   please stop since there is no definition of a minor state there is no need to put it there is algeria minor iran its a nonsense phrase so it should be deleted as for making ma a country code for western sahara its not ma is a code for morocco and so it is in moroccos infobox eh was created for western sahara so that is its country code as far as the territory being occupied this is a clear fact and the position of the united nations it is also mentioned in the article in other places tcm  it does not need a definition to be in the article a minor state is used as opposed to superpower states permanent members of the security council  and so on as to the eh domain it clearly states the eh tld is intended for ws but it is not assigned ma being the one used in the territory the same thing applies for the currency the mad is the currency of morocco but that is also the currency you will find in use in the territory the same thing goes for the iac 212 the time zone 0 coordinated universal time and so on they are the ones used in the territory these things have been a matter of hotted debate before and they settled on the way they have been before you started tempering with them as to your ridiculous claim of the un considering the territory as occupied i already explained to you the difference between a un position through the security council that is reiterated again and again and a voting poll in 1979 of the algeriancuban drafted document that has no obligation on the un the zionismracism example is the brightest one for you to understand it i will revert to the version that was in use before the anon ip started this mess   it does since minor states doesnt mean anything you cant use it in this article its nonsense what states that ma is being used in the territory do you have any evidence of this at all the same thing does not apply to currency since there is no administrative body that assigns currencies to regions to ask which currency is used in a region is different than to ask which toplevel domain name has been assigned to the region the former is defined entirely by usage the latter is defined entirely by standards western sahara is clearly occupied as the article itself still states im not going through this with you again tcm   ah were back to having fun again arguing about trivialities minor states is indeed a value judgement  although arguably the states recognizing are largely minor on the global arena algeria is not a big newsmaker per se but in the interest of neutrality merely noting african asian and latin american states seems reasonable at the same time if koavf gets to bleat on about minor it seems reasonable that controlled be used rather than occupied same standards on language     evidence on ma usage would be found with sites for entities ostensibly domiciled in western sahara provinces using ma it is trivially easy to find that koavfs immature partisanship notwithstanding    what is an example of a website with an ma domain name which has the server in western sahara  d trebbien talk 2340 2008 may 5 coordinated universal time  good question since effectively all internet service to the western sahara is via maroc telecom or other moroccan operators one would expect that most servers would be located in moroccan territory exws provinces largely in the casarabat area technically i am unaware of any way to determine where the physical server is actually located versus the service presumably the regional investment office of laayoune  may have its server physically in laayoune other similar offices may also it strikes me as useful for the article to indicate like country code most sites use the

0512db238fec2eb7,  mario party 4 is the fourth in a series of board game style video games for nintendo platforms featuring popular nintendo characters it was released on the nintendo gamecube in north america on october 21 2002 strangely before the japanese release on november 8 2002 it was released on november 29 2002 in europe being heavily criticised for being nintendos big gamecube game for christmas 2002 as metroid prime was delayed until march 2003  mario party 4 was the first mario party that was released on the nintendo gamecube each board had its own host including toad goomba shy guy koopa and boo mario party 4 also contains some characters new to the franchise thwomp and whomp klepto dolphin lakitu and star along with two completely new characters named genie of the lamp and ztar are included as well mario party 4 retains the story mode found in mario party 3  the game as usual contains a standard party mode in which up to four players play through a board trying to collect as many stars as possible the star space would appear randomly on the board and players would have to reach it before anyone else however the stars carry a price tag of 20 coins and player has to earn those coins by winning minigames which take place at the end of each turn after all the players have rolled the dice block which will always roll a number from one to ten  battle minigames are like the 4player games but generally with many exceptions a little more elaborate battle games are usually tense because every player has to put a certain number of coins from 5  50 into a pot first place gets 70 of the pot second place gets 30 and a random player gets any coins lost in rounding   every mario party contains 60 to 80 minigames of a few different types fourplayer games are a freeforall in which all players compete against each other 2on2 and 1on3 minigames put players in groups so they have to cooperate in the minigame to win even though they are against each other in the main game in most situations winners of these games make 10 coins each  a new addition to the mario party series was the bowser minigames players play in a very elaborate minigame that ends when one player is eliminated in various ways see bowser minigame section below the loser loses a prespecified item usually coins or items  gameplay boards  toads midway madness  goombas greedy gala  koopas

always in the small box battle space  a battle minigame will start in which players put a chosen amount of coins into a pot the better you finish in the minigame the more coins you will get back from

statements leading to the source links would qualify as synthesis it would be highly objectionable from wikipedia to keep those links unchallenged for the time being and when someone gets around to rewriting the original material in the specific blog posts the links will be trashed out at this point 1 the sentence being vague and inaccurate can be corrected 2 it seems that if you articulate a sentence validated by some sort of source that is not a direct quote in most cases some synthesis is involved 3 there is still the issue of the site being a reliable source it seems to me that the wikipedia efforts to keep the wackos with weird theories at bay is leading editors to substitute verifiability intelligibility and common sense by arguments of authority this would set me going into a long winded argument about what is happening to wikipedia once lauded as the place to come as you are becoming stiff purely factual and tight in such a way that it carries a lot of knowledge but no understanding this in turn carries into a discussion about public education and the work that carl sagan is known to the general public for cosmos was not about this marble statue said so but instead these are the reasons why we think so to me the posts in the disputed site i linked to are interesting but that maybe just my own personal opinion and wikipedia users having them available is positive constructive and enriching for wikipedia and thats the reason i linked to them in the first place throwing them out all of them seems like excluding a whole plethora of good things the baby with the bath water because a wikipedia directive says so just because it does not noticing the directives were written to prevent bad things from happening it would seem to me not to exclude good things by statute so the reliable source rules are something i would like to discuss a bit more at length   ,0.0,hie dvdm write follow made edit cant right come review detail exampl thank johnuniq advic input

this article as it exists is just wrong  i believe wikipedia would be better served by deleting this article and adding a new subsection in the races and caucasian articles if it this is not changed to reflect what 999 of the people on this earth consider a white person to be this 999 obviously not including alun  slrubenstein  when it comes down to it the term white person cant really be defined its technically not a race and any references sited are going to be garbage as you can find hundreds of them from what could be considered reliable sources that directly defy one another  all that could be done for this article would be to direct it towards a view that most people agree with or delete it entirely but as it currently exists i say again its a joke  you can cite all the references you want and state all the wikipedia rules you want you just cant understand that what you believe just isnt what an overwhelming majority of the rest of the human race does and as i said before theres no way of either side proving the case for either side here as white people dont scientifically exist  so since you guys are obviously the type that will fight to the bitter end for some

055c9cafcdb359f9,   pseudonymous editing   copied from an email received offline hi  im not quite sure how this works but your wrote in my deletion review you say that your name and address are available but your contributions to wikipedia are pseudonymous  does this mean i hadnt registered i did so last night and not under a pseudonym as most people have i always use my real name in signatures  and i dont know how to post to your talk page because there appears to be no post link  thanks dennis bathorykitsz bathorybathoryorg bathorymaltedmediacom  thanks for your message but i think perhaps my meaning was still unclear  whether you register or not doesnt really matter since anyone can register under any name  i could go online and register a wikipedia account as george w bush at least if its not already taken  wikipedia has no means to authenticate your identity independently  all that we know  all that we can know  is what you choose to claim about yourself    thats what i meant by pseudonymously  any registration even if you say that its your real name is technically a pseudonym  it is not independently verified against some external identity database  and for the most part that works out very well on wikipedia  we want users and editors to establish themselves through their actions and to demonstrate their expertise through their edits not by making claims to outside credentials  by the way anyone could also register as dennis bathorykitzs  that trivial misspelling would be easily overlooked by readers but would still be accepted by the system  such a person could sign their name the same way you do attempt to mimic your pattern of speech well writing really and make subtle edits just to discredit you  that in fact is a real problem for established editors of wikipedia  when we find usernames that are suspiciously similar to established users we look very carefully for signs of vandalism or deceit  users who appear to have done something like that on purpose are generally banned from wikipedia  but those are all manual checks  there is no system that can automatically detect or prevent it  likewise no one can inherently trust the email address  the way internet domains are set up anyone could register bathoryorg and create any email name they wanted  like wikipedia accounts emails and internet domains are unverified against any external identity authority  and thats before you consider the problems of email spoofing and forgery  both of which are far easier and common today than any of us would like to admit  most people are honest  but there are enough dishonest people out there that we have to build our systems and our procedures in such a way that it doesnt matter whether they are telling the truth about their identity or not  thats why wikipedia has a policy against original research which we mean as a contribution or assertion based on personal experience and why we never rely solely on selfpublished materials and why we bias our policy so strongly in favor of reliable sources such as websites owned by and operated by large wellknown organizations  organizations with both a vested interest in and the resources to find and stop spoofing  sorry to bore you with all this but my nonwikipedia profession is information security  the inherent problems of identity management and authentication occupy much of my waking hours  how can a bank know that youre really you  and how far can that trust be extended  under what conditions can an assertion be treated as reliable  how do we balance that against the need to make systems and computers easy and accessible  unfortunately there are no easy answers short of establishing a national identity database  something which would be in great tension with my role as a privacy advocate    anyway ill get off my soapbox now  thanks for your message  to post to my talk page just go to the page and edit it like you would edit any page on wikipedia  the most common technique is to use the little plus sign next to the edit this page tab at the top  that will automatically create a new section and give you a line to create a section header without having to know the wikimarkup symbols  you should also get in the habit of signing your posts on talk pages  you can do that easily by ending your comment with four tildes   when you save the page the mediawiki software will replace the tildes with your username and the datetimestamp  again welcome to wikipedia   talk ,0.0,pseudonym edit copi email receiv offlin hi im quit sure work wrote delet review say

05687bcb86751fc2,the ctmu is not passing itself off as an academic theory it cant because langan is not a member of academia but then again a theory need not be academic to be notable for example print and television journalists and their readers and viewing audiences can deem things notable as well nor do academics have a monopoly on logical or factual correctness scholarly integrity or intellectual merit except possibly in the wellindoctrinated minds of some academics themselves and of course their aspiring apprentices whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflates their academic snobbery to blimpish proportions  byrgenwulf complains that we chaps are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article this is correct to his credit he invites others to tag his assertions however this is a bit specious for having belatedly come to the realization that he has no relevant verifiable assertions to make he is now specializing in challenging the assertions of others thus we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of langans assertions receive a separate citation when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article   it is important for byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article but given that the article already links to ample source material anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false irrelevant or nonneutral unfortunately he hasnt yet been able to lock onto this signal he still labors under the assumption that like some sort of ultimate bureaucrat he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself    by now everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization neither byrgenwulf nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates has any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations they are merely using the article which is faithful to the material it cites to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic the ctmu which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks they do not like what the ctmu says the article on the ctmu reports on what the ctmu says and what langan and the press say about the ctmu hence they do not like the article on the ctmu   this conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in byrgenwulfs transparent strategy of attacking the theory through the article attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger meanwhile he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of wikipedia verifiability policy and that his alltooevident editorial bias is in massive violation of npov as well oozing contempt byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the ctmu article with a load of summary demands snide remarks and selfrighteous factually worthless criticismbut not one relevant citation in hand nothing he says is verifiable as we have now repeatedly seen he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert this makes it very difficult if not impossible to take his demands seriously           ,0.0,ctmu pass academ

commercial use for commercial news photography as the template you used states use of historic images from press agencies must only be used in a transformative nature when the image itself is the subject of commentary rather than the event it depicts  its intended for images which are themselves iconic works of art so that we can use the images to primarily facilitate discussion of the image   even ignoring the legal problems with using the news photography wikipedia has a hard requirement for freely licensed images because nonfree media compromises the freely licensed status of wikipedia refer to the first rule at wpnfcc nonfree images are not to be used unless obtaining a freely licensed could not be reasonably believed to be possible there were undoubtedly thousands of photographs of this balloon taken by amateurs and professionals alike almost any would do for the purposes of the article wikinews claims that the balloon was lowflying and that photographs were captured by area residents    the best way to get an image for the article would be to leave a placeholder in the article requesting that the public submit one the effectiveness of such a place holder will probably

05c6ca0daefe69ba,   this is a potentially ridiculous article   seriously it is a potentially ridiculous article and mislead readers to comprehend the word x86 for the following reasons  1 should sort amd64 or intel64 implementations as x86 generally x86 was used to point all the processors compatible with ia32 isa might or might name themselves with 86 such as cyrix 5x86 intel pentium 4 and so on amd64s long mode is devised by amd rather than intel so how can one sort them together nowadays software labeled themselves as x86 are ia32 compatible software and use x64 or x8664 differentiating with it so this article confuses reader getting in touch with this word   2 generations what is the 8th generation x86 processor who invented this kinda processors amd k8 just says that it succeeds amd k7 rather than saying it is the 8th x86 processor and ive never heard intel call their x86 processors exceeding the 7th generation and one thing should never be denied the first generation of itanium processor says its family model number as 7 which might potentially imply that itanium might be the 7th x86 processor succeeding pentium iii but none confirmed this so take turn back the transmetas crusoe and efficeon if the morph firmed on the system board implements x86 decoder call themselves as x86 processors then if put the same processor on another board implementing powerpc decoder then it would be the powerpc processor at this situation what kind of processor is it ridiculous whats more for what sort it as the 7th8th generation x86 who is another jane austen making up

0625a9a8d601235c,  alex thank you for your reply i could indeed use a break from this case but yesterday was a very eventful day as the case closed and then agk answered a question id initially posed on august 22 meaning that he refused to engage regarding the false allegation he made against during the brief window during which i had a chance to respond to the fof and then when it made the response it not only confirmed the judgment on content aspect of the fof if begs the question as to why he cited another diff including an exchange with arzel in which arzel not only ignores the content of academically published rs he openly denigrates them in a thread where blocks of text of the formisano text for example had been under direct discussion  regarding the perceived legal threat i had no intention to make a legal threat that was all sort of sarcastic play on words relating to specific sequence of events in the case starting with newyorkbrads comment on my fof on august 23 to which agk refused to reply publicly until the case had been closed yesterday more than two weeks later there were also email exchanges between myself and nyb and agk which i will have to forward to jimbo wales at some point after clarifying one point made by nyb on his talk page  the import of the substance is firstly a pun insofar as i make an insinuation about sophistry in the legal field in relation to my perception that agk aspires to become an attorney or whatever theyre called in scotland it is secondly an indication that i have taken the time to register at wikipediocracy for future reference regarding earlier comments i had made about the court of public opinion and when did a little looking around there finding an entry about nyb for example who had advised agk that he didnt see any misconduct in some of the points of the fof so it was thirdly an indirect suggestion that he learn something from someone that is already an accomplished attorney   if the reiteration of material deleted by agk from his user page within the past two weeks is outing then that is a policy i shall have to examine note that i am not the only editor to have broached the issue of his being an undergraduate in the context of his judgment and actions acting in the capacity of arbitrator in the case at issue  theres much more to say on this but i need to get a couple more hours of sleep i have tried to leave links to relevant discussions at jimbos talk page but have only provided a partial synthesis of the situation not even contrasting the complete lack of an fof on arzel for instance with the response provided to me on the pd talk page shortly after the case was officially closed yesterday  if this statement settles some of the concerns regarding my intentions and the severity of

0651104ccfe11df5,kenneth tennysons reckless behavior in other forums  as far as kenneth tennyson bashing other authors here is an exerpt from a book review on amazoncom  founder of the homemade mushindo karate movement never studied under a legitimate teacher or any martial art teacher never set foot in asia completely disproven shown to have plagiarized many photos and other materials from other published written sources of course he claims to have studied under masters in tibet and been a disciple of okinawan karate teachers  since disproven by such worthy sources as gorge mattson et al was involved in an abusive sex scandal with several female students a few years back sleep with me and ill enlighten you kinda thing uses abusive and coercive tactics to control what exstudents say at him a propaganda liemaster   the person he is bashing is none other than terrence dukes or the real frank dukes from the movie bloodsport  while putting others down kenny brags or advertises about his martial arts expertise to scare people  hmmm well kalaripayattu has a lot of similarities with caopera alot of jumping and posturing and a lot of religious themes to it i guess it depends on what martial arts youve trained in to determine whether i can kick a or not lets see im a red belt second degree in tae kwon do and have some knowledge in shotoken ive got to start learning about grappling though   freedom skies and myself are not the only ones who feel that kenny is a racist here are some excerpts from users from other forums  the armchair analyst  asia times forum i see however you sounded like a racist no i have no south asian sensitivities i am no nationalistjingoist i consider myself above it all   all your posts are based on the rather silly assumption that militaristic power in the last three centuries is a sign of greatness it may be in a narrow anglosaxon way but not in a gandhibuddha sort of a way get it  civilizations such as india actually even china until today have never had a negative impact on other civilizations that remotely matches yours  you have generalized indians to be bigots and so on i agree that some not all are but the fact that you generalized it to include an entire ethnic group as obnoxious by definition makes you a racist yes it does   rocky  asia times forum what inaccuracy are you referring to if brits came to india and got rich was the wealth indian or british besides looting what exactly did british accomplish while your bias is clearly visible with this statement what is your purpose of posting this in this forum  isnt it quiet evident that even in yr 2005 it is difficult for you to get off your pompus ass why on earth would anything written by anglosaxon when europeans were busy colonizing the world accurate isnt there a vested interest on part of the european to disparage native cultures and delibrately belittle their achievements   thats just a couple of the many others however i do not want to clog up

06573ec80185634b,  hmmm i was actually writing a response as you sent yours oh well for the record my response was this  resurrecting articles is frowned upon yes we might be able to get away with it if the article we resurrect is a substantial improvement on the last one however  though of course we both know that theres no guarantee it would ultimately be accepted whatever we did  there is an established bias towards deleting articles on individual matches changing the name would be nice but im not sure what we would change tothe game didnt really have a name like the ballet on ice or any such and there are limited other ways of naming the article  making this subpage was a decent idea you just got unlucky in that its something that has already been tried elsewhere and ultimately voted against honestly i can say ive never seen a subpage for an actual mainspace article so i have no idea how much people tend to chase these articles up or whether it might just glean a communitywide shrugging of the shoulders certainly theres been no afd nomination yet which is a start i have to say i somewhat favour making it a standalone article or merging with the season article that is not keeping the subpage but i dont have strong feelings so ill run with whatever works if it got categorised it would either be put into a category for something like categoryfootball matches i have no idea if that exists it was another example and categoryfa cup and then probably into a new category for city matches or comebacks or somesuch where it probably would be on its own that category would then have to be categorised so it wasnt just an orphan i dont know what the ethic is here for creating categories with only a single article in them but i suspect its not encouraged so that idea might be rejected if whoever did it couldnt find more likeminded articles to categorise into the same i dont think it being categorised would really affect anyones opinion of the article though the one thing that might affect peoples judgement right now is that it will in its present form show up in categories as 200304 manchester city fingers crossed seasonspurs 34 city or however the subpage is actually named given the  in the name  yes id say it will currently be located in an overarching please categorise these pages category i dont know how long it would take for it to get sorted but it would probably be put somewhere generic better to do it ourselves i guess  sorry my thoughts were a bit disjointed but i was answering the points as they came andwell better english just didnt quite flow from my fingers as i typed hopefully i addressed all your points ill settle for just keeping the subpage if you want it though i think that page would be best served by being redone  with as many citations as possible  and expanded upon so we can argue a case for it being reincluded into society so to speak having an article afded isnt a permanent sign that that article should never exist its merely a suggestion that it shouldnt exist in the state its in generally speaking most articles that get deleted will be kept the second time around if their quality andor level of detail is substantially improved  as for the charity shield i always considered it a notable trophy yes its a single game but it requires winning a trophy to qualify in the first place ignoring those early years when some teams refused to play to this end id consider it more of an accomplishment than winning the trophy which qualified you for it similarly would you question the worthiness of the european super cup in fact because some teams initially didnt enter city were instrumental in making the charity shield the respected competition it is today by taking their place in the competition

in says the term may be pluralized as either rbi or rbis obviously not vandalism then but a difference in opinion then matt guerrier the reason it didnt show up was because a  was missing and with your edit you reremoved it and duplicated info its amazing how you continue to assume bad faith blindly reverting and editwarring over messages on his own talk page tc   danged if this little war isnt over some seriously picayune crap both sides are being a bit petty here because really either set of edits is acceptable on these pages well except for the bolded contract on ian kinsler  either make it a subhed or take it off seriously  oh and technically the plural of rbi is rsbi but that just looks clunky in common usage rbi is used for either singular run batted in or plural runs batted in rbis is a bastardization used only because its simpler from a usage standpoint  either way i think everyone involved in this should chill out for a few days and just leave all these pages alone     jackal4 again is making a rash of these edits on every page i touch  as to rbis as x96lee15 pointed out the most thorough treatment is at wikipediatalkwikiprojectbaseballarchive5rbis  plus mlbcom is the official reporter of baseball and uses the rbis convention  yet jackal4s reaction to that is to go on pages where i have written it thus to delete the s  as though the s is incorrect  he has done the same with at bat  which he insists must be hyphenated  etcetera  these are just two of the types of reverts he feels impelled to make of my edits  it is picayune but it is wrong to revert perfectly good edits  if he insisted on lowercasing rbis or any similar degradation i would think it wrong of him to follow people around and revert perfectly good edits  there is enough good work he could perform instead     well i cant stop him from wasting time if thats what he wants to do     as for thorough treatment im not sure i consider a bit to which a grand total of two people contributed particularly thorough i respect kingturtle but i think hes got it wrong on this one regarding what mlbcom uses youre appealing to the wrong authority because its not a terminology issue its a grammar issue   in any case at this point i have no doubt that these edits are being reverted simply because youre both watching for each others names on your watchlists allow me to again encourage the both of you to just stay away from each others edits entirely for a while and allow the bad feelings to ebb at the rate youre going youre both going to get blocked     jargon overrides

are committed for a racist or xenophobic purpose are punishable as criminal offences  public condoning denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide  as defined in the statute of the international criminal court articles 6 7 and 8 and crimes defined in article 6 of the charter of the international military tribunal when the conduct is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred against such a group or a member of such a group   example somebody publicly claims that an act of genocide the commission of which has been established as a fact by an international court never happened and was invented by the ethnic group concerned solely for the purpose of being able to claim compensation payments this allegation would not only deny the genocide committed against the ethnic group concerned but would also incite hatred against this group in the future all member states would be compelled to criminalise such a case   whether a specific historical crime falls within these definitions must be decided in each concrete case by the court which has jurisdiction in the case of the holocaust for example this was done by the nuremberg tribunal  as we see the law is restricted to cases when  the commission of genocide is established by an international court and  the denial is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or

arvanitika they can and should be used arvanitic has the majority vote and therefore that shall be used what is wrong with it it is neutral it does not prescribe that arvanitic is a language or a dialect and as it has been pointed out the reader can review all the evidence for himselfherself and see what heshe thinks wikipedia should not take sides and especially wikipedia should not say that unesco britannica and so on aree wrong macedonian and luxembourgish and so on can be treated as languages because all neutral credible sources say they are while the same sources say that arvanitic is a dialect if britannica or unesco and so on said that they were dialects then they could be treated as such no neutral source formally aknowledges that they are dialects why should they be treated as such every neutral source says that arvanitic is a dialect and therefore should be treated as such and the word language should not be in the title we can discuss possibilities of it being a language in the text but not in the title arvanitic is neutral and will be used as it has received he majority support possibilities of arvanitic being a language in its own right can be discussed in the article not in the title as that would be a violation of wikipedias policies what unesco britannica and so on say is assumed correct according to wpv and wpnor i am not labeling arvanites albanians against their will are we labeling the irish english against their will by calling their language hiberno english a dialect of english no so stop that straw man argument arvanitic is neutral and will

official border between europe and asia and there is a great number of unofficial versions so you might think that it is logical to explain all of the versions that exist for today on that page      well sadly thats not what most editors think they put one version there and every time i changed it it went back to the previous version now i am just wondering do these people think it is their personal page or what gives them the right to rely on several sources and ignore other ones that are not any less trust me they should definately offer every version of where the border goes between the two continents instead of putting only one version  and not even bothering to explain why it is unacceptable i contacted one of the editors and heshe said that he chose that version because heshe thinks it is the most neutral one i am sorry but what some users think should be completely irrelevant while making an article on the website which has an ambition to be credible they should include all of the versions or not include anything at all before there is an official border  council of europe the oldest organization in europe classifies country as european  country is in the middle of the nato membership process only european countries are eligible for it according  to the north atlantic treaty and they are not even mentioning why they left it out turkey is not the case because it was already amember of nato cant they understand that page is not about the eu its the entire europe as a whole and until the borders will be determined officially all of the versions should be

page hi cmagha i never saw the original afd discussion but i think the article looks like the start of something fantastic my only concern would be that the majority of your references seem to come from cornell specific sources that is cornell daily sun cornell era cornell register and so on college university published sources are a bit of a grey area within wpn when dealing with a campus organization as some may not consider these to be independent of the subject that being said we arent dealing with a fly by night college band that played at moonshadows and had a writeup in the ithacan this is a literary society almost as old as cornell university itself and has had significance well beyond east hill despite the large number of see you oriented sources which i personally believe are independent you have enough that would be unambiguously independent to survive another afd if need be id post what you have now and keep looking for more  says you says two    wow great work  sorry ive been out of the loop  double smiley face from the syracuse orangemen brought in to ensure neutrality  think the critics need to read the article from a distance  this is hardly promotional when you think about it  it is basically saying that cornell university had a chance to excell in an intellectual activity and tanked  we obviously would not have done that at su  i do

075a4b83f3eba42f,changes to this page  open discussion  since my first contribution over two months ago i have been trying my best to make known my views on what improvements could be made to this page after an initial consultation with an administrator i decided to be bold and start a dmenagement of all that had nothing to do with the city of paris i was met with opposition over a link  and after being complained about i thought it best to put things back the way they were until i could get a good feel of the general concensus of the pages contibutors i have seen little concensus but a lot of silent stalling  my goal here is not to control anything as was complained to one of the administrators  i would like only to contribute to making a better page i have learned much from other paris pages and pages concerning french history  namely those concerning the french kings  but those are well covered as far as knowledgable contributors are concerned and are in little need of improvement so i had little to do there this page on the other hand i find lacking and see many things that could be improved  the most important fault this page has is its quantity of specialised information  far too much for a general paris page the search function is a very important element of wikipedia and with this in mind much on this page is redundant and unneccessary those looking for paris economy will type exactly that into the search window the same for paris history or paris fashion here i am but repeating what i have already written below  in short in order to make this page a comprehensible tool for one looking for a lead from the subject of paris or one totally ignorant on the subject   in other words one who knows only enough to type only paris into the search window  i propose to move the more specialty information to their own pages my apologies to those who have contributed the more detailed information but this would be better suited to a specialty page of its own this would even be a positive move as it would allow the contributor knowledgable in the subject of his contribution to expand his input far beyond what could be contained on this one page  the irony of the sort is that though i contribute to wiki it wont be to this page in any quantity my specialty is the history of paris and i cannot even think to add that knowledge here  paris history has a page of its own just to give you all a clear idea of where my aims are  here i would like to contribute in the interest of clear information i hope with this post to create an opportunity for improvement  please answer with any ideas you would have with this post i would also like to sound the board  to see whether it is an interest for information or partisanship that holds the upper hand on this page as what i have seen to date leaves room for doubt in your answers i hope for evidence to the contrary   please feel free to forward any thoughts on the matter at all     addendum   you can find a proposition for restructuring here    please keep in mind that this is only a structure reference marked only by short notes i dont really want to cut everthing out   ,0.0,chang page open

in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth then christian death turned it upside down  history officially there have been over 30 musicians involved with the band therefore a historical litany of them all would be impractical  formed in los angeles and fronted by 16 year old vocalistlyricist rozz williams the band released the first album only theatre of pain in 1982 a dark sinister style of punk rock the album gained local success a year later the band completely broke up  singer rozz then joined the band pompeii 99 founded by singer guitarist song writer valor rozz took over vocals leaving valor to focus on guitar before rozz joined pompeii 99 the band had already released their fist album look at yourself to much acclaim which had an apocalyptic theme with a punk rock flavor the pompeii 99 had been planning their first tour when it was proposed by their french record company to merge pompeii 99 into a new version of christian death which after some debate was agreed upon thus began the new christian death and the first pompeii 99 tour became the first christian death tour  part way through the tour the band stopped in wales to record songs some of which were originally intended for the next pompeii 99 album the fusion of which led to the unique sound of the classic catastrophe   ballet like the first pompeii 99 album catastrophe ballet had an apocalyptic theme however the music morphed into something not quite pompeii 99 and nothing like the first christian death album after the tour the band returned to la to later record the 3rd christian death albumasheswhich was a post apocalyptic vision of a cold and bleak future   after confirming the 2nd tour in 85 singer rozz quit the band valor returned to vocals the band embarked on the 2nd tour in italy the band recorded the mini album the wind kissed pictures a surrealist view of a mystical past almost immediately work began on the 4th full length album atrocities inspired by the atrocities of world war ii and the connection to future shock waves while continuously touring in 87 the band released the 5th and now classic album the scriptures the theme of which explored world religion and how the legacy of these beliefs impact our world today  1988 brought us the release of sex  drugs  jesus christ this was turning point for the band the cover depicted an image of jesus shooting up heroin this was a full frontal attack by valor against the church with a scathing heretical mockery of organized christianity the band then found themselves confronted by protesters riots and bomb threats these events and the bands imagery and fashion went on to influence the likes of nine inch nails korn marilyn manson type o negative every goth band on the planet and many others  1989 saw the release of the double album epic all the love all the hate interpreting the juxtaposition between life and death day and night man and woman black and white  in 1991 came the release of insanus ultio proditio misericordiaque with its theme of an ancient dream state  late in 91 after being in several other bands and seven years after quitting christian death rozz was

0789ee63f04dff9b,  parts of my own talk page deleted by editors who think they know better  dear impartial but not disinteresed reader coren and i have been having an entertaining and enjoyable discussion on the finer points of soapboxing  she is of the firm resolute belief that this version of my own talk page amounts to soapboxing and has deleted it  i recognize that there may be elements of soapboxing in the investment predictions for 2008 section at the bottom of the page but have given her the opportunity to amend rather than delete the whole section  she has declined the opportunity to amend leaving me in the difficult position of having to type this with a knife pressed eversogently against my back with coren carefully looking over my shoulder at the screen to check whether anything is in her godlike view soaplike  not the most pleasant position to be in i can assure you  to use another example picked completely at random lets say theres been a nasty and vicious and ugly and persistent edit war over say fractional reserve banking and a number of editors want a messy but more informative version like this one kept in  then lets say i post this earlier version on my talk page for readers to compare with the now inmyhumbleview slaughtered version  is that soapboxing  to use another example closer to home  lets say a guy like zenwhat says to his coconspirators what can we do to have our version of debtbased monetary systemfractional reserve banking prevail like he clearly said here under the desperate heading heeeeelp    and then he also bizarrely asks gregalton help him delete references to misesorg like he did here saying to gregalton also in case youre interested one of the easiest ways to find economics articles that have been vandalized is to do a search for links to misesorg  as if a reference to the great ludwig von mises amounted to vandalism can you believe it  i have to hold a pencil between my teeth just to keep control of myself and keep typing this  the guy is clearly a vicious tiny weeny little troll    he also says to his coconspirator the following on the same page   i looked at the fractional reserve banking article recently and saw how it was so horribly vandalized it made me realize that were going around in circles we improve the articles to the point that they look great then they get screwed up again so i had an idea would you be interested in helping me write an essay on monetary crankery it could help people who arent educatedthe idea is for it to be straightforward with references but polemic and satirical of monetary crankery  clearly this guy is obsessed with deleting or satirizing any positions on monetary theory that dont agree with his  the guy is mad  if the guy had napalm or nukes hed use them without hesitation     then for good measure he goes back to debtbased monetary system to do more editing    zenwhat is clearly a piece of work  check out the dudes talk page  in addition to his obsessive interest in deleting anything associated with misesorg his main interests appear to be something called cannabis culture and the buddhist connection with marijuana  so i gather from this that his main interests are monetary theory and dope smoking  what a combo  seeing this i ponder my options  i decide to post a note here on my own talk page asking readers to compare older better versions of some important articles on monetary theory with the current versions  for good measure i offer my predictions on the financial markets for 2008 as a gift to the eight people persistent enough to read my humble little talk page    it immediately gets deleted by allseeing allknowing coren as soapboxing  is this strict compliance with wp guidelines or a wpstyle fascist dictatorship where people like coren delete at will but dont bother to make constructive suggestions as to how what i have written can come within the guidelines      this is like watching evolution in reverse  i carefully construct a page with the help of others  it gets vandalized by those with a clear and obvious objective to delete or satirize all references to ludwig von mises or the austrian school who knows what motivates these sickos  instead of engaging in pointless edit wars with idiots i ask t,0.0,part talk page delet editor think know better dear imparti disinteres reader

07c37d50746b980c,   talkramon berenguer iii count of barcelona   talkramon berenguer iii count of barcelona might interest you     peter iii of aragon   what is your rationale for preferring the late portrait of peter over a contemporary coin your edits are predominantly changes to lead images yet you almost never leave an edit summary explaining them you also reverted my change without even knowing what contemporary means or whether a certain image was contemporary with the subject or not the reasons to prefer the coin are it is a contemporary artefact giving information about peters reign w a caption and about how he was seen by his subjects in his lifetime the coin does not mislead readers about the times of peter iii as the portrait might the silver coin on a white background is more striking than the somewhat garish portrait in lowresolution jpg format it is far more likely that the limited detail of the coin is accurate clean shaven and longhaired than the greater detail of the imaginary portrait the later portrait is one of a series of nearly indistinguishable royal portraits from two centuries later it gives us no information about peter or his reign its sole purpose was decorative what makes the coin an image of peter is that that is when it was struck and what for but what makes the later portrait an image of peter is that somebody labelled it that waythey could just as easily have labelled an image of any other aragonese king  in your last edit summary you ask if i have to choose between two unreal representations i prefer the portrait but nobody is asking you to choose or what you prefer     srnec the problem is that we have different criteria  you think the images should provide information about the lives of the persons and be of the age in which these people lived i think the only thing to do is to give a visual representation of the person the article is to the information  i think that a portrait even if wasnt painted during the live of the person is most valid that a little image carved in a coin the two representations have the same chance of not being 100 accurate but at least one illustrates better than the other  if not exist any portrait of this person then i accept a coins image or a poor drawing but the present picture accomplish the role and i think that it must be more time    i already argued why the coin is a better illustration and youve just asserted the contrary do you have an argument why are your criteria better than mine     really when i rebutted all your arguments in your talk page i stated my reasons but i do not want another long discussion with you i offer consensus would you take a picture of the first part of the thirteenth century   both of those are improvements over the 17thcentury image but not over the coin at least one other editor agrees with me    sorry im not agree with your second comment but i hope we have made a step in the right direction this discussion is already too long both images are the best ones that meet your rigid standard of closeness to the characters life either both seem right     imposing your personal preference is not how it occurs on wikipedia   i

everything on this page based on your mindreading trick you quote out of context and misrepresent when you describe part of my questioning as the lack the intellectual ability comment by the perverted interpretation of standards you are trying to apply to me your accusation of me not treating others as human beings is a personal attack if it wasnt so silly i would spend time thinking more on it which may lead to concluding that it is a straight up personal attack heres a few points for you to think on  wpcivil wpagf  wpnpa  are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles then lets consider the arbcom an article what then is this articles content hmm lets see  the arbcom is an article so what is the arbcom made of why members so that means the content of the committee is its members so an election is a decision on the content of this article so members are editors so content is editors so in order to write this article we must discuss the content we must discuss the editor who is to become part of the content you dont like that wpcivil wpagf  wpnpa  are all policies written in mind for the writing of encyclopaedic articles but arbcom is not an article it is an election to decide which persons are to be members of that important committee we must discuss the editors who are to become members of the committee we cannot question articles about their content nor can we ask the content questions but we can ask the proposed contents of the arbcom questions is a certain level of intellectual ability pertinent to arbcom membership if you do not think so how many of the present arbcom do you consider stupid would a low intellect on arbcom help or hinder if there is evidence a diff of intellectual failings does the candidate realise this failing can he explain it as something other than an intellectual failing the questions were politely put they were challenging and they were meant to be and anyone in the community which includes me has the right to ask candidates challenging questions on their past performance there was no name calling all questions were relevant to a quality of the candidate pertinent to his ability to perform on arbcom they were not deferential which may be the actual cause of the consternation you and others displayed your threats of blocks i regard as an attempt to bully do not try to bully me finally i
