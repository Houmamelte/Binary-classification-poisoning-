24,000cfee90f50d471,  reconsidering 1st paragraph edit i dont understand the reasons for s recent edit of this article  not that im sure that the data are necessarily wrong  rather im persuaded that the strategy of introducing academic honors in the first paragraph is an unhelpful approach to this specific subject  i note that articles about other sitting justices have been similarly enhanced and i also believe those changes are no improvement    in support of my view that this edit should be reverted i would invite anyone to revisit articles written about the following pairs of jurists  a1 benjamin cardozo  a2 learned hand   b1 john marshall harlan  b2 john marshall harlan ii  the question becomes would the current version of the wikipedia article about any one of them  or either pair  be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph  i think not  perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument kathleen sullivan of stanford law makes when she suggests that some on the harvard law faculty wonder how antonin scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging  i would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point   less humorous but an even stronger argument is the one clarence thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to yale  at a minimum im questioning this edit  it deserves to be reconsidered   ,0.0

81,0033b9d5ccd499fb,  is it scientific to attribute an event a to cause b where cause b was deliberate designed with some sort of intelligent intent dont answer the questions beyond that well the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged there are several major fundamental problems here    first you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind id is quite literally not of this earth natural science might look at a honeycomb see it is built by bees and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees that is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth id has at its core the notion that something outside the system we can observe is at cause here this is not science in any sense of the word it is mythology when paul bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes no evidence of paul and his ox remain i mean really    second natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up id turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with probabilities if no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally how in the hell can id proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate probability of flagella naturally forming on bacteria if you dont understand it you cant do statistics on it id jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesnt have a complete detailed natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say well its so improbable for this to happen that someone must have designed it this is such a perversion of science you can assign probabilities to something you dont understand id is just making up their numbers    finally your example has ab where b was deliberate design thats all well and good for a rigged example except that with respect to life on earth b is unknown your ab example might qualify as forensic science if a were a dead body and b were a bullet in the heart you see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart you can probably figure thats what killed him you dont have that with life on earth you have one scenario a and you have no other cases to observe or test so in that sense ab is not scientific if youve never actually observed b by the way b is teh intelligent designer which has never been observed so in that sense no it isnt science  ,0.0

114,004b975fabbbffa9,paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized  however the term fossilized is not a very precise term  there are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil  one major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate invertebrates radiolarians sponges plants pollen foot prints and so on  and multiple processes may include permineralization recrystalization carbonization replacement dissolving diagenesis and so on  talking about fossilization is a complex issue however quick burial is not questioned  the major question is how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in  experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab which of course implies that given the right conditions vast ages are not an issue  the metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains  flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood but rather that there has been some 4000 years for the processes to have been working  much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains  yet how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with,0.0

214,008a1e9c45de8138,   randroide answers to next step   guys i do not see you taking steps to wikipediarequests for mediation  i can not do this job because i always connect from filtered institutional netaccess and following those steps could result in new undesired controversial truncation of words by the software i do not want that happenning  could you please follow the instructions in the link i provided thank you    randroide answers to new reference by burgas00     at last we agree on somethingof course that the new section is a good idea the false suicidal terrorists from prisa will also be included there   come oooooon boys start writing that section i do not want all the kudos for myself the new proposed article is by now an effort made only by me   but remember npov and sources all the sources just like me citing el pas in the section about the doubts about the genuineness of the 13th bomb cheers       indeed a good point and all the remarks in cope too and the moral certitudes of mariano rajoy published in el mundo    i agree with you 100 larean    what randroide omits to mention on the section about the 13th bomb is that he only added balancing references when i insisted that he do so the original version he created was entirely point of view as is much of the rest of the proposed article also all the sources that he added from el pais are only available to subscribers  npov it is not     you are right southofwatford in your randroide omits section  if you have not subscription to el pas i am sorry but thats your problem my institutional access also has some advantages like paid access to el pas and many many other publications and books thats one of the reasons for my exclusive use of filtered internet accesss its much easier for me to work here due to the easy availability of sources  do you see the truncation of words is offsett i think by better sources  by the way if you write under a randroide answers section you are invading my space i do not mind really but you are doing it risking new truncations on your messages to avoid this please write outside randroide answers sections  if you think that the proposed article is point of view work in it to make it npov the article is not mine    ill take the risk of you truncating the reply and put it here its very short the issue is not whether i subscribe to el pas its whether the people who read an article in the english wikipedia subscribe to it all sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article putting in a source that readers will not be able to see just so you can claim the article is npov is to my mind completely unreasonable      all sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article  very funny southofwatford   i am going to follow this joke of yours  please propose also the deletion of all books as sources because did you know there is always someone without this or that book delete all references to tv or radio stations because that user in brazil has no tv and no radio at home delete all the references in spanish because did you know there are users who know no spanish  its a pleasure to read this kind of funny jokes really i had a good laugh  usersouthofwatford  how strange that you should find it so funny after all most of the sources we are providing should enable users to find out more information about what is being sourced so to deliberately choose sources that require those users to pay to see the information is not funny its simply bizarre equally in the english wikipedia i would argue that choosing a spanish or other foreign language source when an equally valid source exists in english does not make sense except perhaps to those who are too busy laughing  your cynicism is evident in your response   083,0.0

321,00ced92ee28c7ee8,  661858580s rant  presently we are witnessing  an open war against croatian dinaric culture  croatian left often portrays this culture as primitive and rural even fashist being  in  service of conservative hdz party croatian writer predrag raos for instance performed on gusle instrument in zagreb on several occasions this year 2004 with only one intention  to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition   another apostle of croatian left  miljenko jergovi  refers to his political opponents on the right as gusle players   some even claim the serbian origin of croatian dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater serbian propagabda all tokavian people and their culture are serbian however croatian dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly croatian dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture for example the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music marko kraljevi is associated with dalmatian island hvar through petar hektorovis book ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje 1568 also the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  dubrovnik 1547 even now a contemporary croatian writer born in dubrovnik stijepo mijovi koan tells us a story about his uncle also from dubrovnik area who could memorize numerous gusle songs stijepo mijovi koan gusle glasnik may 25 1992 p 42 dubrovnik is also a home of anica begin born kalafatovi 1816 a daughter of famous gusle player ante although illiterate she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs some of which were recorded in antology of croatian folk poetry    not far from dubrovnik another coastal city  makarska  was  also a bastion of croatian gusle music actually this region could be considered the capital of all croatian gusle players this mediterranean area  also gave birth to  andrija kai mioi 18th century catholic priest who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of croatia and beyond to honour kais work ivan metrovi the most famous croatian sculptor built a sculpture in america showing kai in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument    in addition to kai makarska littoral produced a great many other followers of croatian gusle music according to dr fra karlo jurii who quotes the work of croatian folklorist stipan banovi zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with stipan kosovikudri 17711818 and culminating with the most known mate banovi  trli 18441915  as for dalmatian women they didnt play gusle its    considered   a male activity only yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound   olinko delorko the researcher of  dalmatian  folk poetry in the 1960s states in his book ljuba ivanova 1969 that most of his dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women especially the ones from the island of hvar   the zadar littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition english writer maude m holbach travelling through zadar region in the first decade of 20th century  states in her book  dalmatia the land where east meets west that the gusle was the national instrument of the region as for dinaric dances which took place at markets and certain festivals they  are very picturesque and interesting and worth going a long way to see being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in europe p54  this admiration for dinaric folk music particularly gusle was seen in both dalmatian litteral and  hinterland  matija murko the researcher of this literarymusic forms  had reported   that during his trips  through dalmatia in the 1930s he saw a child barely three years old playing gusle eduard osredeki hrvatske narodne junake pjesme eljeznobe p 9  now lets  take a look at  the names of some dalmatian sports clubs and organizations hajduk junak gusar alkar uskok sinjska alka and so on what do they have in common of course their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region   having this in mind one wonders why this proud croatian heritage has become almost  extinct  why do we have so few gusle players today  is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock n roll  culture  if so why has tamburitza music of northern croatia  gained wide acceptance from the croatian establishment while its  dinaric counterpart gusle music is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre,0.0

482,0141bcdf68c13b91,in history there could be a consensus view or a mainstream view in theology there is no mainstream or consensus view since most of theology depends upon the church membership of the theologian historical scholarship aims at universality and objectivity while theology makes no such claims it is true that there are millions who believe that jedp was birthed in hell or would believe it if they knew what jedp means so in principle their view is notable but as enns said it is a fringe view in the academe even among scholars who actually disagree with jedp the sources used to build wikipedia are academic sources therefore jedp and its 2021st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to wpundue this does not mean that wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong wikipedia has no theology of its own but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view of course this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties since as ehrman said in one of his bestsellers us mainline protestant and catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes so in a sense scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions only fundamentalist seminaries and divinity schools choose to default against historical criticism they are free to do this but this cuts against their claims of being mainstream historians,0.0

550,01726bfc7b29b8c9, tim firstly i appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour yes i certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in there is clearly a massive diffence between say having offices in the french or japanese jurisdictions or between the chinese and us jurisdictions since the legal and regulatory systems are very different as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets   beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in say paris or toulouse even though they are both in the same jurisdiction i appreciate that the situation in the us is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though to give an example the san jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the los angeles market but it will also have a quite different profile  on the whole a lot more specialist niche and focused on high tech    to give another example in the uk a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didnt have an office in london even if it had offices in every other big city in fact all of the very top tier uk firms dla piper is not yet regarded as one of them despite its size have just one uk office in london although they have other offices overseas    saying that dla has  has 69 offices across the united states egypt south africa kenya thailand china  would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader we could fall back on using descriptions like in major financial centres or in major commercial centres or in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesssary element of vagueness imprecision and even original research   i do accept that dla with 69 offices is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article however i do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it and should be included as much as possible    ,0.0

669,01d14606bf9ea4ba,   stradbroke galleon  portuguese   hallo moondyne i do admit that when i signed onto wikipedia i was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge nazis but now that i am aware of it i will make the appropriate adjustments i was under the obviously mistaken impression that wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts knowledge and information the notion that the stradbroke galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about discussed and investigated for more than 100 years by historians and historical groups such as the royal historical society of queensland the maritime archaeology association of queensland and many more too numerous to include here there exists in various libraries books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which i have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the wp domain the fact that a story is not accepted by mainstream academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions what has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group that is hesperian and his friends who are representatives of the mainstream view hesperian complain about the media coverage i have recieved but this never appeared in any of the wp contributions i made and hesperians mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for hesperians antagonistic attitude simple old fashioned professional jealousy thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by hesperian for personal reasons for example the portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an aboriginal midden identified by a spanish musuem offical and story told to me by a uq archaeology phd student is very relevant to the theory of the portuguese discovery of australia this kind of knowledge suppression is not what wiki is about but i guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by hesperian and his little band of mates which is a pity but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should i expect wiki be any different still it is dissapointing happy trails    ,0.0

697,01e325ea4bf0f8a3,   why confusion and controversy in the real world does not preclude the writing of a good wikipedia on the topic   ackoz suggests that because the real world has not yet hashed out the truth about the expulsions it is therefore impossible for us to know the truth and thus impossible for us to write about it  i reject such a stance  i think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality wikipedia article about a topic that is murky andor controversial  where many wikipedia editors get it wrong is that they believe wikipedias job is to report the truth  this is wrong  wikipedias job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is  any attempt to do that is original research  instead of truth wikipedia aims for verifiability  put a different way wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion not our opinions but those of reliable sources  if the truth is clear and uncontroversial it is easy for us to report that  if the truth is murky and controversial it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic even if these reliable sources conflict  where wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents the truth and not just one perspective or point of view on the topic at hand  i have been trying to hit this npov sweet spot but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides    obviously is because some users jadger and wikiferdi dont want to discuss in fact they want us to agree with their point of view thats not discussion about the npov edits thats why i quit from the discussion about the form of the article talk ,0.0

893,0270bbf8002b4476,well arthur i have printed the paper and the condition is in fact what ultrapower says it is not your correction it seems that the paper is not incorrect but rather correct and pointless  you have already identified the worst problem the third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values however this problem disappears if we consider only the special case ae so lets do that  we want a function f satisfying f1e and fn1expfn defined as widely as possible we observe that n0 and n1 present no problems f01 and f10  to extend f to all positive real numbers it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length 1 such as 01  and we want f to be continuously differentiable the paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on 01 or equivalently on 10 this is obviously whacky but we neednt worry about this because ae  next for no obvious or explained reason we require that f  is monotone on the interval 01 from the functional equation fx  ln fx1 we get f x  f x1fx1 hence f 1f 0f0f 0 so f  must be constant on 01   not too surprisingly the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way fx  expxexpxx  thus what i learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between 1 and 0,0.0

904,027ddece1b86f804,unblockill make a renewed effort not to give personal attacks but of course i do have some questions about this unwarranted blockage as you might well imagine  1 why is it that ip editors tend to get the raw ends of the deal that you admins tend to lean towards the side of someone whos editing with an account over someone whos editing without one especially in the area of what you label as personal attacks or harassment when given by the ipeditor but not so much when the named editor does the same thing  2 for exampleand this is yep maybe you guessed it question 2 why is it supposedly okay according to you for someone with a name like say escape orbit to dish out a personal attack but not for me to give him one back because im just a lowly ipeditor specifically why is it supposedly okay for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of ebay logo to go next to the current one ebay in the lead is because i wanted it in there even though that is a total lie but its supposedly not okay for me to call that kind of slander stupid  3 heres another one why is it supposedly okay for him and smiley girl there to falsely accuse my edits of being vandalism just because they differed from what these guys preferred but then when i say their reversions are vandalism i get in trouble for it as if it were a personal attack just because im an iponly editor  4 ready for one more then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us ipeditors a warning template but when i as an iper do the same thing to a named editor like i did to partially smiley girl i get dinged with oh you cant do that cause thats a personal attack or oh thats bad because thats harassment   5 oh yeah heres one more remember the rule about editwarring just in general meaning that it doesnt even have to be breaking 3rr that says that  but i was right so i was not editwarring is no defense well then doesnt that apply to meeting some socalled consensus too since some things arent cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that socalled consensus wanted the thing to say well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some editwarring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive partial consensus wants it to say and since my editing had already been established as not vandalism even though it disagrees you ignore that abovementioned editwarring rule and give herhim a pass anyway but when i an iponly editor whos against your exclusive consensus do the same thing its editwarring even though it was the same thing as what smileys doing remember the beingrightmatchingconsensusisnodefense rule  7516221181    ,0.0

1051,02df732c2dcab497,thanks to all for taking my rather offhand comment seriously  to reiterate my original explanatoin to james im interested in this more on a meta level how do we approach controversial subjects than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards moore and his film that is im trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about  for an encyclopedia based around the concept of a neutral point of view any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is in itself an editorial statment seems wrong such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article  see for example something like roe v wade  theres no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved  there are other articles for that linked at the bottom  just state the facts about the case  even if you really consider moores movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda and to risk the wikiequivalent of godwins law here note that the article on triumph of the will doesnt feel the need to explain all the reasons why nazi germany wasnt all it was cracked up to be   similarly shouldnt we just describe the content of the movie noting that it is controversial and then if we want an article about the bin laden family departure or whatever we can put the facts about that subject there   2019 5 jul 2004 coordinated universal time,0.0

1075,02ef17606e21709a,  this is untrue  i have not been blocked for the reasons mentioned but rather for entirely different reasons since the reasons mentioned are not actually true  it is impossible to exhibit a battleground attitude because of many reasons including the fact that one cannot exhibit something unless one is a display engineer at a museum and it would therefore be impossible to exhibit anything let alone a battleground attitude the fact that there is no such thing as a battleground attitude the fact that there is no such thing as an attitude in regards to how a human being acts and the fact that the word exhibit is used in an incorrect manner here done solely for the purpose of antagonizing the user antagonizing me  usage of words like exhibit and attitude and refusing to follow the section title requirements on my page show an obvious malfeasance intent by the above person and therefore the block cannot be valid because within the first sentence he has already seriously demonstrated his lack of appropriate intent by specifically and purposefully being antagonizing    the second claim is physically possible but is blatantly false  i have specifically attempted to prevent other users from refusing to communicate in a appropriate manner as he was repeatedly replying to the same conversation in several different locations for which i reported him but yet the people at the alleged help desk refused to tell me where to report him and even deleted several of my replies and then archived it fraudulently  having other users delete my comments participate in blatant fradulentism post the same thing on multiple talk pages at once for the purpose of harassing me and so on is hardly myself making it difficult to communicate when in fact as was just demonstrated i did the literal exact opposite of this by literally attempting to prevent other users from making it difficult to communicate  in addition if i wish for other users to not communicate with me i also have that right it is in fact specifically written into law in every state in the country and will get you arrested if you fail to do so  although i personally disagree with this law and it is an immoral law which deems to prevent for example exspouses from communicating with each other when necessary the part of the law that refers to strangers such as on wikipedia or anywhere on the internet it is a personal choice whether you wish other strangers on the site to communicate with you or not andor post contact information and so on  that is why every message board in existence has an option to disable the private messaging system  there were no personal attacks done by me anywhere so this part is a baseless and fraudulent claim  refusal to abide by the sites guidelines is impossible since 1 guidelines and rules are two different thing 2 wikipedia does not have any rules and 3 all policies of any kind are subject to debate and protest at any time according to the numerous wikipedia articles which specifically say this  you have also demonstrated more incorrect intent by saying that something was done in multiple venues even though no venues of any kind exist because this is a website rather then a collection of several different building which show concerts or other entertainment events andor conventions andor and so on  so that is also impossible ,0.0

1897,0525305ab014194a,   hie dvdm i was writing what follows while you made your edit i cant right now but i will coming to review in detail your example thanks johnuniq for your advice and input concerning the actual statement i had already thought that after clearing things up with dvdm i would rephrase it into something in the lines of he is an iconic and inspirational reference for the generation growing up in the late 1970s early 1980s adding to some of the generation should clear your objection about the absence of stats but thats not the really important issue here the fact is that it is ethically improper from me and from wikipedia to declare that the you call it blog site is not a reliable source here but then find that the links and statements in inertia coupling or alexander abian are significant enriching contributions to the users of wikipedia and the sourced site is reliable there by the way in these two and the few other topics the source is mentioned the statements leading to the source links would qualify as synthesis it would be highly objectionable from wikipedia to keep those links unchallenged for the time being and when someone gets around to rewriting the original material in the specific blog posts the links will be trashed out at this point 1 the sentence being vague and inaccurate can be corrected 2 it seems that if you articulate a sentence validated by some sort of source that is not a direct quote in most cases some synthesis is involved 3 there is still the issue of the site being a reliable source it seems to me that the wikipedia efforts to keep the wackos with weird theories at bay is leading editors to substitute verifiability intelligibility and common sense by arguments of authority this would set me going into a long winded argument about what is happening to wikipedia once lauded as the place to come as you are becoming stiff purely factual and tight in such a way that it carries a lot of knowledge but no understanding this in turn carries into a discussion about public education and the work that carl sagan is known to the general public for cosmos was not about this marble statue said so but instead these are the reasons why we think so to me the posts in the disputed site i linked to are interesting but that maybe just my own personal opinion and wikipedia users having them available is positive constructive and enriching for wikipedia and thats the reason i linked to them in the first place throwing them out all of them seems like excluding a whole plethora of good things the baby with the bath water because a wikipedia directive says so just because it does not noticing the directives were written to prevent bad things from happening it would seem to me not to exclude good things by statute so the reliable source rules are something i would like to discuss a bit more at length   ,0.0

1997,05687bcb86751fc2,the ctmu is not passing itself off as an academic theory it cant because langan is not a member of academia but then again a theory need not be academic to be notable for example print and television journalists and their readers and viewing audiences can deem things notable as well nor do academics have a monopoly on logical or factual correctness scholarly integrity or intellectual merit except possibly in the wellindoctrinated minds of some academics themselves and of course their aspiring apprentices whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflates their academic snobbery to blimpish proportions  byrgenwulf complains that we chaps are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article this is correct to his credit he invites others to tag his assertions however this is a bit specious for having belatedly come to the realization that he has no relevant verifiable assertions to make he is now specializing in challenging the assertions of others thus we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of langans assertions receive a separate citation when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article   it is important for byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article but given that the article already links to ample source material anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false irrelevant or nonneutral unfortunately he hasnt yet been able to lock onto this signal he still labors under the assumption that like some sort of ultimate bureaucrat he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself    by now everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization neither byrgenwulf nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates has any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations they are merely using the article which is faithful to the material it cites to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic the ctmu which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks they do not like what the ctmu says the article on the ctmu reports on what the ctmu says and what langan and the press say about the ctmu hence they do not like the article on the ctmu   this conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in byrgenwulfs transparent strategy of attacking the theory through the article attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger meanwhile he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of wikipedia verifiability policy and that his alltooevident editorial bias is in massive violation of npov as well oozing contempt byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the ctmu article with a load of summary demands snide remarks and selfrighteous factually worthless criticismbut not one relevant citation in hand nothing he says is verifiable as we have now repeatedly seen he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert this makes it very difficult if not impossible to take his demands seriously           ,0.0

2005,056ebf729a0c5c23, 20 september 2011 coordinated universal time ill try to take the points in turn hope i get this format right   wpblpgossip states that be wary of sources that use weasel words and that attribute material to anonymous sources i am not aware of any weasel words or attribution to anonymous sources i am not sure how the section applies if you could be more clear it would be helpful   the phrase involve claims about third parties is so vague as to not be any assistance by this metric so little can be used that its almost meaningless someone stating their birthdate or the grade school they attended but for a person saying i have a conflict with jenny smith over issue x  where do we draw the line it could easily be said that an actor and actress divorcing with one placing on their personal publicist website a statement about separating for reasons of x is a claim about third parties but i wouldnt argue it is unreliable nor unencyclopedic to include in the biography of either individual one can take things too far and i think in this case the avoidance of even mentioning the existence of dispute is getting to the point where people are being literalist and not using their common sense 763123691  2051,0.0

2275,0625a9a8d601235c,  alex thank you for your reply i could indeed use a break from this case but yesterday was a very eventful day as the case closed and then agk answered a question id initially posed on august 22 meaning that he refused to engage regarding the false allegation he made against during the brief window during which i had a chance to respond to the fof and then when it made the response it not only confirmed the judgment on content aspect of the fof if begs the question as to why he cited another diff including an exchange with arzel in which arzel not only ignores the content of academically published rs he openly denigrates them in a thread where blocks of text of the formisano text for example had been under direct discussion  regarding the perceived legal threat i had no intention to make a legal threat that was all sort of sarcastic play on words relating to specific sequence of events in the case starting with newyorkbrads comment on my fof on august 23 to which agk refused to reply publicly until the case had been closed yesterday more than two weeks later there were also email exchanges between myself and nyb and agk which i will have to forward to jimbo wales at some point after clarifying one point made by nyb on his talk page  the import of the substance is firstly a pun insofar as i make an insinuation about sophistry in the legal field in relation to my perception that agk aspires to become an attorney or whatever theyre called in scotland it is secondly an indication that i have taken the time to register at wikipediocracy for future reference regarding earlier comments i had made about the court of public opinion and when did a little looking around there finding an entry about nyb for example who had advised agk that he didnt see any misconduct in some of the points of the fof so it was thirdly an indirect suggestion that he learn something from someone that is already an accomplished attorney   if the reiteration of material deleted by agk from his user page within the past two weeks is outing then that is a policy i shall have to examine note that i am not the only editor to have broached the issue of his being an undergraduate in the context of his judgment and actions acting in the capacity of arbitrator in the case at issue  theres much more to say on this but i need to get a couple more hours of sleep i have tried to leave links to relevant discussions at jimbos talk page but have only provided a partial synthesis of the situation not even contrasting the complete lack of an fof on arzel for instance with the response provided to me on the pd talk page shortly after the case was officially closed yesterday  if this statement settles some of the concerns regarding my intentions and the severity of the infractions thereby diminished i would appreciate a reduction of the length of the block to facilitate my engaging in the necessary efforts to conduct the appeal without having to exclusively rely on the email system    ,0.0
2276,0625ecc7cdb47fd3,i found a better reference in page 24   theoretically polygamy can assume any one of three possible forms polygyny or the marriage of one man to two or more wives at a time polyandry or the coexistent union of one woman with two or more men and group marriage or a marital union embracing at once several men and several women  of these only the first is common  and on page 25   a statistical analysis of kaingang genealogies for a period of 100 years showed that 8 per cent of all recorded unions were group marriages as compared with 14 per cent for polyandrous 18 per cent for polygynous and 60 per cent for monogamous unions  the disadvantage of working at a medical school is that the anthropology texts are not extensive but they arent checked out often either this had been sitting on the shelf for over 20 years deep in the recesses of the basement murdock is a sufficient reference for polygamy including group marriage,0.0

2355,0651104ccfe11df5,kenneth tennysons reckless behavior in other forums  as far as kenneth tennyson bashing other authors here is an exerpt from a book review on amazoncom  founder of the homemade mushindo karate movement never studied under a legitimate teacher or any martial art teacher never set foot in asia completely disproven shown to have plagiarized many photos and other materials from other published written sources of course he claims to have studied under masters in tibet and been a disciple of okinawan karate teachers  since disproven by such worthy sources as gorge mattson et al was involved in an abusive sex scandal with several female students a few years back sleep with me and ill enlighten you kinda thing uses abusive and coercive tactics to control what exstudents say at him a propaganda liemaster   the person he is bashing is none other than terrence dukes or the real frank dukes from the movie bloodsport  while putting others down kenny brags or advertises about his martial arts expertise to scare people  hmmm well kalaripayattu has a lot of similarities with caopera alot of jumping and posturing and a lot of religious themes to it i guess it depends on what martial arts youve trained in to determine whether i can kick a or not lets see im a red belt second degree in tae kwon do and have some knowledge in shotoken ive got to start learning about grappling though   freedom skies and myself are not the only ones who feel that kenny is a racist here are some excerpts from users from other forums  the armchair analyst  asia times forum i see however you sounded like a racist no i have no south asian sensitivities i am no nationalistjingoist i consider myself above it all   all your posts are based on the rather silly assumption that militaristic power in the last three centuries is a sign of greatness it may be in a narrow anglosaxon way but not in a gandhibuddha sort of a way get it  civilizations such as india actually even china until today have never had a negative impact on other civilizations that remotely matches yours  you have generalized indians to be bigots and so on i agree that some not all are but the fact that you generalized it to include an entire ethnic group as obnoxious by definition makes you a racist yes it does   rocky  asia times forum what inaccuracy are you referring to if brits came to india and got rich was the wealth indian or british besides looting what exactly did british accomplish while your bias is clearly visible with this statement what is your purpose of posting this in this forum  isnt it quiet evident that even in yr 2005 it is difficult for you to get off your pompus ass why on earth would anything written by anglosaxon when europeans were busy colonizing the world accurate isnt there a vested interest on part of the european to disparage native cultures and delibrately belittle their achievements   thats just a couple of the many others however i do not want to clog up this page  i have also noticed that kenny tends to have a habit of cutting and pasting articles and also cloning the article he had fabricated on a few web sites  i know that i am not the only one who knows thisbrahman  martial arts planet forumi really do hate to post on this topic seems as it was only to counter mine which by the way it would be nice if you would simply post this on my topic were you could get a real discusion were as here people might simply ignore you becuase of the topic cloning   bliss  asia times forumthats not from a social studies journal you fraud thats a copy paste   rocky  asia times forumi believe kenneth probably picked up a website of some tourist board,0.0

2360,06573ec80185634b,  hmmm i was actually writing a response as you sent yours oh well for the record my response was this  resurrecting articles is frowned upon yes we might be able to get away with it if the article we resurrect is a substantial improvement on the last one however  though of course we both know that theres no guarantee it would ultimately be accepted whatever we did  there is an established bias towards deleting articles on individual matches changing the name would be nice but im not sure what we would change tothe game didnt really have a name like the ballet on ice or any such and there are limited other ways of naming the article  making this subpage was a decent idea you just got unlucky in that its something that has already been tried elsewhere and ultimately voted against honestly i can say ive never seen a subpage for an actual mainspace article so i have no idea how much people tend to chase these articles up or whether it might just glean a communitywide shrugging of the shoulders certainly theres been no afd nomination yet which is a start i have to say i somewhat favour making it a standalone article or merging with the season article that is not keeping the subpage but i dont have strong feelings so ill run with whatever works if it got categorised it would either be put into a category for something like categoryfootball matches i have no idea if that exists it was another example and categoryfa cup and then probably into a new category for city matches or comebacks or somesuch where it probably would be on its own that category would then have to be categorised so it wasnt just an orphan i dont know what the ethic is here for creating categories with only a single article in them but i suspect its not encouraged so that idea might be rejected if whoever did it couldnt find more likeminded articles to categorise into the same i dont think it being categorised would really affect anyones opinion of the article though the one thing that might affect peoples judgement right now is that it will in its present form show up in categories as 200304 manchester city fingers crossed seasonspurs 34 city or however the subpage is actually named given the  in the name  yes id say it will currently be located in an overarching please categorise these pages category i dont know how long it would take for it to get sorted but it would probably be put somewhere generic better to do it ourselves i guess  sorry my thoughts were a bit disjointed but i was answering the points as they came andwell better english just didnt quite flow from my fingers as i typed hopefully i addressed all your points ill settle for just keeping the subpage if you want it though i think that page would be best served by being redone  with as many citations as possible  and expanded upon so we can argue a case for it being reincluded into society so to speak having an article afded isnt a permanent sign that that article should never exist its merely a suggestion that it shouldnt exist in the state its in generally speaking most articles that get deleted will be kept the second time around if their quality andor level of detail is substantially improved  as for the charity shield i always considered it a notable trophy yes its a single game but it requires winning a trophy to qualify in the first place ignoring those early years when some teams refused to play to this end id consider it more of an accomplishment than winning the trophy which qualified you for it similarly would you question the worthiness of the european super cup in fact because some teams initially didnt enter city were instrumental in making the charity shield the respected competition it is today by taking their place in the competition twice you could argue that of all the teams to have ever played in it we should be the ones most ardently defending it  talk ,0.0

2396,0671aae800c94774, 27 july 2007 coordinated universal time  although i understand your arguments i am surprised you dont understand mine  i dont find it labyrinthine or at least not particularly so  not more than many other events and aspects concerning the beatles  nor is the interpretation in question in any way obscure since it can be taken from any number of texts on the beatles  however though i support the original authors intent here i guess you and i are going to have to agree to disagree over this point for now  at some point however i will source hisher statements  as soon as i find time to delve into the texts  just because i would appreciate reaching some sort of accord with you  until then i dont think we will make much more progress on this    the problem with something like this is that there is no absolute truth  but to me discrediting the original authors intent is like a dog biting its own tail  from wikipedia re abbey road being the final album or notabbey road is the eleventh official album recorded by the beatles although its release preceded that of let it be it was the last album to be recorded   after the neardisastrous sessions for the proposed get back album later retitled let it be for release paul mccartney suggested to producer george martin that the group get together and make an album just like the old days  just like we used to free of the conflict that began with the sessions for the white album martin agreed to this if the band would be the way they used to be in their interviews for the beatles anthology series the surviving band members stated they knew at the time this would very likely be the final beatles product and therefore they agreed to set aside their differences and go out on a high notere the position of the endthe end was initially intended to be the final track on abbey road but it is followed by her majesty in the first practice mix of the medley constructed on 30 july her majesty followed mean mister mustard  and so on  this labyrinth has already been walked through a thousand times by a thousand people  0958,0.0

2718,0751cf8bc1abeaba,   more description of location please   hello i wondered if someone with the requisite local knowledge would please consider adding a short sentence maybe in the description section to explain where this bridge is i do appreciate that its location is already described in the lead as crossing between things x and y but if you dont already know stockton well or recently this is not necessarily all that helpful i was wondering if you could write a more bottomup description which says something like the bridge crosses the tees at blah or near blah street and so on it is a hundred metres downstream from the foo bridge and b hundred metres upstream from the bar barrage or whatever which it seems to me would nail it in more empirical terms what do you think any yes of course the maps link does nail it assuming the coordinates are right but something in the text which helps in this way would i think be very useful i may be being unusually thick  happens all the time actually but on my first reading  and i was last in stockton in 2007 you see  i was not at all sure where it was wondering if in fact it replaced the other rather nice pedestrian bridge closer to the town centre i cured this uncertainty by looking at the maps yes but the sentence im asking for would have given me more direct access to the knowledeg go on please write it for me you know you want to and i will go and put the kettle on for you thanks and best wishes   ,0.0

2796,0789ee63f04dff9b,  parts of my own talk page deleted by editors who think they know better  dear impartial but not disinteresed reader coren and i have been having an entertaining and enjoyable discussion on the finer points of soapboxing  she is of the firm resolute belief that this version of my own talk page amounts to soapboxing and has deleted it  i recognize that there may be elements of soapboxing in the investment predictions for 2008 section at the bottom of the page but have given her the opportunity to amend rather than delete the whole section  she has declined the opportunity to amend leaving me in the difficult position of having to type this with a knife pressed eversogently against my back with coren carefully looking over my shoulder at the screen to check whether anything is in her godlike view soaplike  not the most pleasant position to be in i can assure you  to use another example picked completely at random lets say theres been a nasty and vicious and ugly and persistent edit war over say fractional reserve banking and a number of editors want a messy but more informative version like this one kept in  then lets say i post this earlier version on my talk page for readers to compare with the now inmyhumbleview slaughtered version  is that soapboxing  to use another example closer to home  lets say a guy like zenwhat says to his coconspirators what can we do to have our version of debtbased monetary systemfractional reserve banking prevail like he clearly said here under the desperate heading heeeeelp    and then he also bizarrely asks gregalton help him delete references to misesorg like he did here saying to gregalton also in case youre interested one of the easiest ways to find economics articles that have been vandalized is to do a search for links to misesorg  as if a reference to the great ludwig von mises amounted to vandalism can you believe it  i have to hold a pencil between my teeth just to keep control of myself and keep typing this  the guy is clearly a vicious tiny weeny little troll    he also says to his coconspirator the following on the same page   i looked at the fractional reserve banking article recently and saw how it was so horribly vandalized it made me realize that were going around in circles we improve the articles to the point that they look great then they get screwed up again so i had an idea would you be interested in helping me write an essay on monetary crankery it could help people who arent educatedthe idea is for it to be straightforward with references but polemic and satirical of monetary crankery  clearly this guy is obsessed with deleting or satirizing any positions on monetary theory that dont agree with his  the guy is mad  if the guy had napalm or nukes hed use them without hesitation     then for good measure he goes back to debtbased monetary system to do more editing    zenwhat is clearly a piece of work  check out the dudes talk page  in addition to his obsessive interest in deleting anything associated with misesorg his main interests appear to be something called cannabis culture and the buddhist connection with marijuana  so i gather from this that his main interests are monetary theory and dope smoking  what a combo  seeing this i ponder my options  i decide to post a note here on my own talk page asking readers to compare older better versions of some important articles on monetary theory with the current versions  for good measure i offer my predictions on the financial markets for 2008 as a gift to the eight people persistent enough to read my humble little talk page    it immediately gets deleted by allseeing allknowing coren as soapboxing  is this strict compliance with wp guidelines or a wpstyle fascist dictatorship where people like coren delete at will but dont bother to make constructive suggestions as to how what i have written can come within the guidelines      this is like watching evolution in reverse  i carefully construct a page with the help of others  it gets vandalized by those with a clear and obvious objective to delete or satirize all references to ludwig von mises or the austrian school who knows what motivates these sickos  instead of engaging in pointless edit wars with idiots i ask t,0.0
